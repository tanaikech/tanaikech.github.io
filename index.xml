      <description>Gists
Description This script provides a simple example for generating Text-To-Speech (TTS) using the Gemini API within Google Apps Script. The Gemini API generates audio data in the audio/L16;codec=pcm;rate=24000 format, which is not directly playable. Since there&amp;rsquo;s no built-in method to convert this to a standard audio/wav format, this sample script includes a custom function to handle the conversion.
Limitations and Considerations  The provided convertL16ToWav_ function is specifically designed for the audio/L16;codec=pcm;rate=24000 MIME type.</description>

      <description>Gists
Abstract This report explores controlling output formats for the Gemini API. Traditionally, prompts dictated the format. A new property, &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo;, allows specifying the format (e.g., JSON) directly. Testing confirms this property improves control over output format, especially for complex JSON schemas. The recommended approach is to combine a detailed JSON schema with &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo; for clear and consistent outputs.
Introduction One of the key challenges when working with the Gemini API is ensuring the output data is in the format your application requires.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a Google Apps Script library including useful scripts for supporting to development of applications by Google Apps Script. In the current stage, the 3 categories &amp;ldquo;For array processing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;For binary processing&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;For string processing&amp;rdquo; are included in this library.
Description When I create applications using Google Apps Script, there are useful scripts for often use. At that time, I thought that when those scripts can be simply used, they will be useful not only to me but also to other users.</description>

Abstract It has already been known that Google Apps Script is a strong tool for managing Google Spreadsheets. When the values are retrieved and/or put for Google Spreadsheet, there is a case that the discontinuous cells are required to be used. This report suggests the Best Practices for processing the discontinuous cells on Google Spreadsheet. From the results of process costs, it could understand the usefulness of using the discontinuous cells with low cost using Sheets API and Class RangeList of Spreadsheet service with Google Apps Script.</description>

In the current stage, Google Spreadsheet can use rich texts in cells. The rich texts can be also managed by Google Apps Script. But, I thought that creating a script for editing the existing rich text in the cell might be a bit complicated. Because, for example, in the current stage, when the text of the rich text of a cell is changed using a script, all text styles are cleared.</description>

In the current stage, unfortunately, the built-in methods of Google Apps Script cannot directly retrieve the values from the XLSX data. From this situation, I have created DocsServiceApp. When this Google Apps Script library is used, the values are directly retrieved from XLSX data by parsing XML data of XLSX data.
Here, as another approach, I would like to introduce a sample script for directly retrieving the values from XLSX data using SheetJS with Google Apps Script.</description>

When Google APIs are used with googleapis for Python, the client is obtained as follows.
creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(service_account_credential_file, scopes=scopes) service = build(&amp;#34;drive&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;v3&amp;#34;, credentials=creds) In this case, when the script is run, the access token is retrieved every time. But, the expiration time of the retrieved access token is 1 hour. Here, there might be the case that you want to use the access token until the expiration time. It is considered that effectively using the access token will lead to SDGs.</description>

This sample script decrypts the salted base64 data of finance.yahoo.com using Google Apps Script.
Recently, it seems that the specification of the key for decrypting the data has been changed on the server side, again. In this update, I looked for the logic for retrieving the key value. But, I cannot still find it. So, in this post, I would like to use a workaround discussed in this thread. In this thread, the valid keys are listed in a text file.</description>

This is a workaround for retrieving the hyperlink from the cell of a number value using Google Apps Script.
As a sample situation, it supposes that a cell &amp;ldquo;A1&amp;rdquo; has a number value like 123, and a hyperlink of https://tanaikech.github.io is set to the cell. In order to retrieve the hyperlink from the cell, it is required to use the methods of getRichTextValue() and getRichTextValues(). But, in the current stage, when the cell value is a number value, when the RichText is retrieved by getRichTextValue(), null is returned.</description>

This is a sample script for checking and replacing a character of U+00A0 (no-break space) with U+0020 (space) as Unicode using Google Apps Script.
When I&amp;rsquo;m seeing the questions on Stackoverflow, I sometimes saw the situation that the script doesn&amp;rsquo;t work while the script is correct. In this case, there is the case that the reason is due to U+00A0 being used as the spaces. When U+00A0 is used as the spaces, Google Apps Script and formulas cannot be correctly run.</description>

This report is a workaround for reflecting the latest Google Apps Script to the deployed Web Apps without redeploying.
Pattern 1 Of course, when the developer mode of https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/dev is used, the latest script can be used without redeploying.
But, in this case, only the permitted users can use it using the access token. when you want to achieve this using the endpoint of https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec without the access token, in order to reflect the latest script to Web Apps, it is required to redeploy.</description>

This is a sample script for searching Gmail messages by Gmail Filters using Google Apps Script.
At Gmail, users can set the filter for the Emails. With this filter, users can filter the Emails of Gmail. But, when the users want to search by the installed filter using Google Apps Script, unfortunately, it seems that this cannot be directly achieved. For example, messages cannot be searched using a filter ID.</description>

This is a simple sample script for uploading a video file on Google Drive to YouTube with the resumable upload using Google Apps Script.
When you want to upload a video file to YouTube using Google Apps Script, when YouTube API of Advanced Google services is used, the maximum file size is 5 MB, because, in this case, the video file is uploaded with multipart/form-data. When you want to use a video file with more file size using Google Apps Script, a resumable upload is required to be used.</description>

This is a sample curl command for uploading a video file to YouTube with the resumable upload using YouTube API.
In order to upload a video file to YouTube with the resumable upload using YouTube API, the following 2 processes are required to be done. The basic process of the resumable upload for YouTube is the same with Drive API. Ref So, I think that this document of Drive API might be useful for understanding the resumable upload process.</description>

This is a workaround for checking the existence of file ID in Google Drive without both the access token and API key.
When you want to check whether the file of the file ID is existing in Google Drive, generally, you might use Drive API and Drive service (DriveApp) of Google Apps Script. In this case, the scope of Drive API is required to be used. By this, the access token and the API key (in the case of publicly shared files) are required to be used.</description>

These are sample scripts for removing the vertical borders of a table in Google Document using Google Apps Script.
Unfortunately, in the current stage, only the vertical borders cannot be removed from the table in Google Document using the Google Document service (DocumentApp). I believe that this might be resolved in the future update. But, in the current stage, when Google Docs API is used, this can be achieved. So, Google Docs API can be used as the current workaround.</description>

Introduction There is a maximum executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes. And, in the case of the custom function and the simple trigger, it is 30 seconds. Ref So users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of the scripts. Especially, it is very important to know the process costs for the array processing, because array processing is often used for spreadsheets and Google APIs.</description>

Description Google Document can use the named range. When the named range is used, the users can directly access the contents using the named range. For example, the developer can guide the users to the specific content in Google Documents using the named range. But, unfortunately, in the current stage, it seems that the named range cannot be directly used by the UI on Google Documents.</description>

From Apps Script Pulse by Martin Hawksey, it was found that the invalid blob of sending the file of HTML form to Google Apps Script side using google.script.run has finally been resolved. In this case, this script can be used with V8 runtime.</description>

This is a workaround for converting the range ID to the range object on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script.
When the named range is put to a cell as the hyperlink as follows,
the hyperlink is like #rangeid=123456789. When this link is clicked, it moves to the cells of the named range. So it is considered that this value of #rangeid=123456789 includes the information about the range of the named range.</description>

This is a sample script for achieving the search of files by is:unorganized owner:me using Google Apps Script.
In the current stage, unfortunately, the files cannot be directly retrieved by searching is:unorganized owner:me with Drive API and Drive service. So as the current workaround, all files are retrieved using the method of &amp;ldquo;Files: list&amp;rdquo; of Drive API with &#39;me&#39; in owners and trashed = false, and the file list is retrieved from all file list using a script.</description>

This is a sample script for converting a range in Google Spreadsheet as an image data using Google Apps Script. Unfortunately, there are no methods for directly converting the range in Google Spreadsheet as an image data in the built-in functions. So in this case, as a workaround, Charts Service is used.</description>

This is a sample script for cropping images in the Google Slides using Google Apps Script. In the current stage, in order to crop the images in Google Slides, it is required to use replace(blobSource, crop) Because, although there is the &amp;ldquo;cropProperties&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;UpdateImagePropertiesRequest&amp;rdquo; in Slides API, unfortunately, in the current stage, this cannot be still used. This has already been reported. Ref
About cropping using replace(blobSource, crop), I thought that how to use might be a bit difficult.</description>

This is a sample script for adjusting the text length to fit in the cell width on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. In this case, in order to fit to the cell width, the font size is changed.
Issue and workaround: Unfortunately, in the current stage, there are no methods for automatically resize the font size for fitting in the cell width in the Spreadsheet service. So in this case, it is required to think of the workaround.</description>

In this report, I would like to report for processing to create new file to the specific folder using Drive API. When the new file is created to the specific folder using Drive API, the property of parents with the value of folder ID is included in the request body of the method &amp;ldquo;Files: create&amp;rdquo;.

Abstract This is a report for detecting quickly checked checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. It supposes that when the checkbox is checked, a function of Google Apps Script is run by the event trigger. In this case, when the multiple checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet are checked quickly, the script cannot be run for all checked checkboxes, because of the response speed of the event trigger. It is considered that to understand the response of event trigger is useful for creating the application for Spreadsheet.</description>

onSelectionChange has been released at April 22, 2020. But this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be used at the released day. But now, I could confirm that this got to be able to be used. So in order to test this event trigger, I prepared a simple sample script. This is a sample script for detecting the change tab on Google Spreadsheet using onSelectionChange Event Trigger with Google Apps Script.
Demo Usage  Please copy and paste the following script to the container-bound script of Google Spreadsheet, and save the script.</description>

      <description>Gists
Recently, it seems that the specification of Google Spreadsheet was updated. Before this, when a cell has only one hyperlink. In this case, the hyperlink was given to a cell using =HYPERLINK(&amp;quot;http://www.google.com/&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Google&amp;quot;) as following figure.
But by the recent update, a cell got to be able to have multiple hyperlinks as following figure. In this case, the hyperlinks are set by the RichTextValue object.
In this report, I would like to introduce the method for setting and retrieving the multiple URLs for a cell.</description>

      <description>Gists
In this sample script, all pages in the Figma file are retrieved and the retrieved pages are put to new Google Slides as the image.
Usage 1. Retrieve access token You can see the method for retrieving the access token at here. Although there is also OAuth2 for retrieving the access token, in your situation, I thought that the method for directly generating the access token on the site might be suitable.</description>

This is a sample script for modifying the revisions of a file on Google Drive using Google Apps Script. This script can be used for not only Google Docs files, but also the files except for Google Docs.
Issue and workaround: Unfortunately, in the current stage, at Google Docs files, the revision of Google Docs cannot be directly changed by APIs with a script. So as one of several workarounds, I would like to propose to overwrite the Google Docs file using the exported data.</description>

Introduction Please be careful! This result can be only used for Google Apps Script.
There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes for Consumer and Google Apps free edition, and 30 minutes for G Suite and Early Access. 1 So many users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of scripts. So it is very important to know the process cost of various situations.</description>

      <description>Gists
This is a sample script for sorting a slice using Golang. Recently, I had a situation for sorting the coordinates of cells of Spreadsheet. As a test case, it thinks of the situation that the randomized cells are sorted. I think that this can be also used for a table except for Spreadsheet.
Sample slice: The sample slice is as follows.
ar := []struct {row intcol intvalue string}{{0, 0, &amp;#34;A1&amp;#34;},{0, 1, &amp;#34;B1&amp;#34;},{0, 2, &amp;#34;C1&amp;#34;},{1, 0, &amp;#34;A2&amp;#34;},{1, 1, &amp;#34;B2&amp;#34;},{1, 3, &amp;#34;D2&amp;#34;},{2, 0, &amp;#34;A3&amp;#34;},{2, 2, &amp;#34;C3&amp;#34;},} When each element of above slice is put to a Spreadsheet, it becomes as follows.</description>

      <description>Gists
This is a sample script for fixing a value putting by a custom function of Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. When a custom function is used, the value retrieved by the custom function of Spreadsheet is automatically updated by recalculating. So in the case that the value retrieved by the custom function is changed by the time, the value is also changed by automatically updating. In this sample script, I would like to introduce a method for fixing such values.</description>

This is a sample script for summarizing Slides as thumbnails. For example, it supposes a Slides including 15 pages. When this script is run, it summarizes 6 pages to one page as images. I created this because there are no methods for directly achieving this. This is useful for myself. If this is also useful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
The flow of this workaround is as follows.
Flow:  Copy the original Slides file as a temporary file.</description>

This sample script is for using the string values to []googleapi.Field for Golang. The property of fields can often be used to the Google APIs. When such APIs are used by the Go library, there are the cases that fields parameter is required to be used. For example, at the quickstart of Drive API for golang, the value is directly put to Fields() like r, err := srv.Files.List().PageSize(10).Fields(&amp;quot;nextPageToken, files(id, name)&amp;quot;).</description>

Introduction Here I would like to introduce about the limitation of images for inserting to Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script (GAS). When you want to insert the images to Spreadsheet using GAS, insertImage() of class Sheet is usually used for this situation. At this time, an error sometimes occurs. This indicates that there is the limitation for inserting images to Spreadsheet. So I investigated the limitation.
As a result, it was found that the limitation depends on the image area (pixels^2) rather than the file size of it.</description>

There are no prepared methods for retrieving the number of lines in the Google Document. So I thought this workaround. If the end of each line can be detected, the number of lines can be retrieved. So I tried to add the end markers of each line using OCR.
At Google Documents, when a sentence is over the page width, the sentence automatically has the line break. But the line break has no \r\n or \n.</description>

This sample script retrieves the difference elements between 2 dimensional arrays using Google Apps Script. In Google Apps Script, 2 dimensional arrays are often used at Google Docs and Google APIs. And from my recent report, it has already found that the process cost of filter() is the lowest in the other loop methods. So I use the script like this.
var ar1 = [[&amp;#34;a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c1&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c2&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c3&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a4&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b4&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c4&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c5&amp;#34;]]; var ar2 = [[&amp;#34;a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c2&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c5&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c3&amp;#34;]];  var res = ar1.</description>

Introduction There are event objects at Google Apps Script. Typically, users which use Spreadsheet often use onEdit(event). Here, I would like to introduce the process costs for the event objects using this onEdit(event).
When onEdit(event) is used for the spreadsheet, event of onEdit(event) has the following structure.
{  &amp;#34;authMode&amp;#34;: {},  &amp;#34;range&amp;#34;: {  &amp;#34;columnStart&amp;#34;: 1,  &amp;#34;rowStart&amp;#34;: 1,  &amp;#34;rowEnd&amp;#34;: 1,  &amp;#34;columnEnd&amp;#34;: 1  },  &amp;#34;source&amp;#34;: {},  &amp;#34;oldValue&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;old sample text&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;user&amp;#34;: {  &amp;#34;nickname&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;sampleName&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;email&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;sample email&amp;#34;  },  &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;sample text&amp;#34; } In this structure, for example, the range of active cell is &amp;quot;range&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;columnStart&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;rowStart&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;rowEnd&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;columnEnd&amp;quot;: 1 }.</description>

When I launched Sublime Text, I noticed that the error occurred. The error is as follows.
ImportError: No module named &amp;#39;yaml&amp;#39; I confirmed that this error occurs when the plugin of Material Theme is read. And the error started to occur after Material Theme was updated, recently.
In this report, I would like to introduce the method for removing this error. The flow is as follows.
 Download a file including library for yaml (PyYAML) from https://pypi.</description>

Description : This sample script is for retrieving emails which replied for received mails. Because there are no samples which confirm whether the owner (me) replied to the received mails, I created this. The point is as follows.
 When there are more than 2 messages in a thread, there might be a possibility to have replied. For more than 2 messages in a thread  The email address of &amp;ldquo;from&amp;rdquo; for the 1st message is the sender&amp;rsquo;s address.</description>

Description There are Class SpreadsheetApp and Class DocumentApp for operating spreadsheet and document, respectively. But there is no Class for operating GAS project. If there is such Class ProjectApp, GAS project can be directly operated by GAS script. I thought that this will lead to new applications, and created ProjectApp.</description>

Google Apps Script API was finally released. From this version, ggsrun uses this API. So ggsrun got to be able to use not only projects of standalone script type, but also projects of container-bound script type. I hope this updated ggsrun will be useful for you.
 To users which are using ggsrun with v1.3.4 and/or less. For retrieving, downloading, creating and updating projects, Apps Script API is used.</description>

There is the bathing requests in the Google APIs. The bathing requests can use the several API calls as a single HTTP request. By using this, for example, users can modify filenames of a lot of files on Google Drive. But there are limitations for the number of API calls which can process in one batch request. For example, Drive API can be used the maximum of 100 calls in one batch request.</description>

When the bound-scripts are downloaded, the project name cannot be retrieved because Drive API cannot be used for the bound-scripts. So when the bound-scripts are downloaded, the project ID had been used previously. Such filename is not easily to be seen. By this additional option, users can give the filename when it downloads the bound-scripts.</description>

When a shape is created to a slide using Slides API, most users give the size of height and width as pt. When the size is retrieved from the created shape as pt, the size is often difference from the given size.
For example, when a square shape is created by giving the height and width of 100 pt, the size which is retrieved from the created square becomes 99.</description>

If the application doesn&amp;rsquo;t use the methods depend on Spreadsheet, Document and Slides, this script can give 3 choices to users.

This is a sample script for combining and mixing 2 objects. Each object is an array which included a dictionary type. When the key of the dictionary object is the same, the values are mixed.
This can be also used for Google Apps Script.
Input var obj1 = [{&amp;#34;key1&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value1a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1a2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key1&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value1aa1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1aa2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key2&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value2a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value2a2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key3&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value3a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3a2&amp;#34;]},];var obj2 = [{&amp;#34;key1&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value1b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1b2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key3&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value3b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3b2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key3&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value3bb1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3bb2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key4&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value4b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value4b2&amp;#34;]},]; Output [{&amp;#34;key1&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value1a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1aa1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value1aa2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key2&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value2a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value2a2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key3&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value3a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3bb1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value3bb2&amp;#34;]},{&amp;#34;key4&amp;#34;: [&amp;#34;value4b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;value4b2&amp;#34;]}] Sample script : Javascript : function mixture(obj1, obj2) {  Array.</description>

Introduction By recent Google update (Google update at October 24, 2017), various new winds to GAS developers were blown. There is &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; as one of the new winds. &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; makes us manage the project using JSON. Especially, the special scopes which have to use OAuth2 process can be used by only setting them to the Manifests. I think that this is the largest modification. However, when scopes are added to a project using Manifests, users who use the project can use only added scopes.</description>

This sample script is for retrieving the size (width and height) of a table in Google Slides using Google Apps Script.
There are no methods for directly retrieving the table size using SlidesApp yet. So I thought of a workaround using Slides API.
 When the slide information is retrieved using Slides.Presentations.Pages.get() of Slides API, the information of tables is also included. In the information, the height and width of table are also included.</description>

      <description>It was found that you can also create new project with your original Manifests using ggsrun. By using this, for example, when you created new project, the project can have libraries, Advanced Google Services and so on at the initial stage. I think that this can be used as a template for Project.

This sample script is for straightening elements in 2 dimensional array using Google Apps Script (GAS). When applications using Spreadsheet are developed by GAS, it usually uses 2 dimensional array by setValues(). And the lengths of each element are required to be the same. On the other hand, data used for the applications might not be the same length for each element in 2 dimensional array. This sample script can be used under such situation.</description>

      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.3.1  Recently, when scripts on local PC is uploaded to Google Drive as a new project, the time to create on Google became a bit long. (I think that this is due to Google Update.) Under this situation, when the script is uploaded, the timeout error occurs while the new project is created using the script. So the time until timeout of fetch was modified from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.</description>

This sample script is for retrieving files with filename included special characters using Google Apps Script. The files are used on Google Drive.
The files with filename of special characters cannot be retrieved using DriveApp.getFilesByName(). This workaround solved this.
As a query parameter, name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is used. This contains is very important. name=&#39;filename with special characters&#39; cannot retrieve such files. Today, it was found that name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is the workaround.</description>

Sample script 1:  You can upload the zip file by converting byte array as follows.  At first, it builds form-data. Adds the zip file converted to byte array and boundary using Buffer.concat(). This is used as body in request.    Basically, this is almost the same to the method using GAS.</description>

      <description>Gist
These sample scripts are for requesting multipart post using Google Apps Script.
In most cases, the multipart request is used for uploading files. So I prepared 2 sample situations as follows. For each situation, the request parameters are different.
 Upload a file from Google Drive to Slack. Convert an excel file to Spreadsheet on Google Drive using Drive API v3.  Multipart post is required for these situations.</description>

      <description>Gist
This is a sample script for retrieving images on Spreadsheet.
Unfortunately, there are no methods for retrieving directly images on spreadsheet using GAS. So I use the method which retrieves URL from =image(URL) and retrieves the image from the URL.
In this case, =image(URL) has to be in the cell. Images embedded by insertImage() cannot be retrieved.
At first, please confirm them.
Sample script : var cell = &amp;#34;A1&amp;#34;; // Cell address with the function of &amp;#34;=image()&amp;#34; var filename = &amp;#34;samplename&amp;#34;; // Output filename  var image = SpreadsheetApp.</description>

      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.2.2  For Google Docs (spreadsheet, document, slide and drawing), since I noticed that the revision files would not be able to be retrieved using Drive API v3, I modified this using new workaround.  The new workaround is to use Drive API v2. drive.revisions.get of Drive API v2 can retrieve not only the revision list, but also the export links. I thought of the use of the export links.</description>

      <description>ImgApp was updated to v1.1.0. New method was added.
2. doResize() Overview This method is for resizing images.
Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to resize images at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and resizes the image using setWidth() and setHeight(). But in this method, the resized blob cannot be retrieved. So although I had thought of other workaround, I had not been able to find it.</description>

I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When the map is embedded to a cell on spreadsheet as an image, the function =IMAGE() is suitable for this situation. However, Class Maps, setFormula() for importing =IMAGE() and DriveApp.createFile() for creating images from maps also cannot be used for custom functions.</description>

      <description>Description There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). It&amp;rsquo;s 6 minutes. So users have to pay attention to the process cost of the script. GAS can use JavaScript 1.7. This means to be able to be used comprehension for GAS.
In this report, the process cost for the comprehension has been investigated. The normal for loop was used as the competitor. As a result, it was found that the comprehension can be used one of methods for reducing the process cost.</description>

      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2017/06/06/embedding-animation-gif-in-a-cell-on-spreadsheet/</guid>
      <description>This sample script is for embedding animation GIF in a cell using custom function on Spreadsheet.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem There are some limitations.
 Images of jpeg and png can be embedded in a cell using =IMAGE(). But when animation GIF is embedded using it, GIF is not played. insertImage() can insert the animation GIF to sheet. But it is not imported to one cell.</description>

      <description>This sample script performs OCR and imports resultant text to a cell using custom function on Spreadsheet.
Drive API has a function to do OCR. It was used for this sample.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When OCR is performed and imported the result to a cell on spreadsheet, there are some limitations. DriveApp, UrlFetchApp, setFormula() cannot be used for custom functions.
Solution In order to avoid these limitations, I used Web Apps.</description>

      <description>This sample script embeds a map to a cell using custom function on Spreadsheet.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When the map is embeded to a cell on spreadsheet as an image, the function =IMAGE() is suitable for this situation. However, setFormula() for importing =IMAGE() and DriveApp.createFile() for creating images from maps also cannot be used for custom functions.
Solution In order to avoid these limitations, I used Web Apps.</description>

      <description>This sample script embeds a chart to a cell using custom function on Spreadsheet.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When you want to create a chart and embed it to a cell using custom functions, you notice that insertChart() cannot be used. There are some limitations for using custom functions. But insertChart() creates floating charts. So in order to embed a chart to a cell, the function =IMAGE() is suitable for this situation.</description>

      <description>gogauth is a CLI tool to easily retrieve access token for using APIs on Google.
I thought that if the access token can easily retrieve, it may be useful for users who can use various convenience Google APIs. So I created this. Also this can be used for testing sample script like the demo. If this will be helpful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
Today, it was updated to v2.0.1. Please check it out.</description>

      <description>This sample script retrieves the user information which is editing the shared spreadsheet.
It was found as follows.
 User information retrieving by Class Session is the owner and users which installed triggers by themselves. When each user installs a trigger, user information retrieving by Class Session losts the accuracy. So user information has to be retrieved using a temporally installed trigger. Using onOpen(), it cannot directly install triggers and authorize.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of APIs on Google. When we use Google Drive APIs, they usually have &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; as a resource. The parameter &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; gives various information which is selected to us. This is one of important parameters. And this can be used at Google Apps Script (GAS) although that version is v2. About how to use it, there are some documents. But it is difficult to find how to use it at GAS.</description>

When you use only &amp;lsquo;onEdit(e)&amp;rsquo; without an installing trigger, &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo; has following parameters.
{authMode=LIMITED, range=Range, source=Spreadsheet, user=, value=test}  In this case, the event cannot send an e-mail because of &amp;lsquo;authMode=LIMITED&amp;rsquo;.
When you use &amp;ldquo;onEdit(e)&amp;rdquo; with an installing trigger of &amp;ldquo;Edit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo; has following parameters.
{authMode=FULL, range=Range, source=Spreadsheet, value=test, triggerUid=#####}  In this case, the event can send an e-mail because of &amp;lsquo;authMode=FULL&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;souwapy&amp;rdquo; is a library for summing array elements with high speed by new algorithm (Pyramid method). The speed is faster than csv and panbdas module of python and v8 engine of node.js. The souwapy module is 2.3 and 3.1 times faster than csv and pandas module, respectively. This was really surprised me. It was found that the theory was correct.
At first, I have created this theory for Google Apps Script.</description>

This script can get the duplicate number of each element in array at Python. In this script, the duplicate number of each element is obtained and sorted by the duplicate number. This was expressed by the comprehension.
data = [&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;] result = sorted({i: data.count(i) for i in set(data)}.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) print(result) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [(&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, 4), (&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, 3), (&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, 2), (&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, 1)] </description>

      <description>Abstract I have already reported that the pyramid method is one of very effectively algolithms for summing string elements in an array using Google Apps Script (GAS). This report describes the adaptability of the pyramid method to any languages except for GAS. c++ (g++), Go, Java, Javascript on Node.js, Python and Ruby were chosen as the sample languages. In those languages, there are languages which have the distinctive commands for summing the array elements.</description>

      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2016/10/13/improved-algorithms-for-summation-of-array-elements/</guid>
      <description>Abstract I considered an efficient algorithm for summation of array elements. All elements in an array are string. When those elements are summed using scripts, a standard method is to add each element in order. If the script is run without any optimize, the process becomes gradually sluggish, because the total amount of active data during the summation process is proportional to the square of the number of array elements. This leads directly to the high process-cost.</description>
