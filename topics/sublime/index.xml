      <description>Gists
When I launched Sublime Text, I noticed that the error occurred. The error is as follows.
ImportError: No module named &#39;yaml&#39;I confirmed that this error occurs when the plugin of Material Theme is read. And the error started to occur after Material Theme was updated, recently.
In this report, I would like to introduce the method for removing this error. The flow is as follows.
 Download a file including library for yaml (PyYAML) from https://pypi.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a plugin of Sublime Text 3 for submitting files to both Gist and Slack.
Description I like to use Sublime Text for developing scripts. And when I discuss about developing scripts, I often use Slack. When I submitted a script to Slack, I had saved the script to Gist as a backup. I had done manually this on my browser. Namely, I wanted to be saving the revision of script while I&#39;m discussing about the script at Slack.</description>
