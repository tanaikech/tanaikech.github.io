      <description>Overview This is a python library to manage the tables on Google Document using Google Docs API.
Description Google Docs API has been released. When I used this API, I found that it is very difficult for me to manage the tables on Google Document using Google Docs API. Although I checked the official document, unfortunately, I thought that it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult for me. So in order to easily manage the tables on Google Document, I created this library.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a python library to retrieve the file list with the folder tree from the specific folder of Google Drive.
Description When I create applications for using Google Drive, I often retrieve a file list from a folder in the application. So far, I had created the script for retrieving a file list from a folder for each application. Recently, I thought that if there is the script for retrieving the file list with the folder tree from the folder of Google Drive as a library, it will be useful for me and other users.</description>
