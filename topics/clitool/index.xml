      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.4.0  v1.4.0 (January 25, 2018)
Google Apps Script API was finally released. From this version, ggsrun uses this API. So ggsrun got to be able to use not only projects of standalone script type, but also projects of container-bound script type. I hope this updated ggsrun will be useful for you.
 To users which are using ggsrun with v1.3.4 and/or less. For retrieving, downloading, creating and updating projects, Apps Script API is used.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a CLI tool to download shared files from Google Drive.
Description We have already known that the shared files on Google Drive can be downloaded without the authorization. But when the size of file becomes large (about 40MB), it requires a little ingenuity to download the file. It requires to access 2 times to Google Drive. At 1st access, it retrieves a cookie and a code for downloading.</description>

      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.3.4  v1.3.4 (January 2, 2018)
 Added new option for downloading &amp;lsquo;bound-scripts&amp;rsquo; of Google Sheets, Docs, or Forms file.  When the bound-scripts are downloaded, the project name cannot be retrieved because Drive API cannot be used for the bound-scripts. So when the bound-scripts are downloaded, the project ID had been used previously. Such filename is not easily to be seen. By this additional option, users can give the filename when it downloads the bound-scripts.</description>

      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2017/10/31/create-new-project-with-original-manifests/</guid>
      <description>It was found that you can also create new project with your original Manifests using ggsrun. By using this, for example, when you created new project, the project can have libraries, Advanced Google Services and so on at the initial stage. I think that this can be used as a template for Project.
$ ggsrun u -pn [Project name] -f appsscript.json  https://github.com/tanaikech/ggsrun/blob/master/help/README.md#ModifyManifests
You can check this and download ggsrun at https://github.</description>

 At October 24, 2017, &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; which is new function for controlling the properties of Google Apps Script was added (GAS). You can see the detail of &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; here. In order to modify the manifests from local PC, I added this new function to ggsrun. By using this, you can edit the manifests and update it from your local PC.</description>

      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.3.2  v1.3.2 (October 20, 2017)
 Updated ggsrun&amp;rsquo;s Install manual (README.md). Since I thought that the manual became too complicated, I separated it to the simple version and the detail version. And also , recently, since Google&amp;rsquo;s specification was updated, about how to deploy API executable and enable APIs for ggsrun&amp;rsquo;s Install manual were updated. From this version, scripts in a project can be rearranged.</description>

      <description>go-rearrange and gorearrange were updated to v.1.0.2 From this version, data included multi-bytes characters can be used. At Linux, it works fine. At Windows DOS, rearranging and selecting data can be done. But the displayed data is shifted. Although this may be a bug of termbox-go, I don&amp;rsquo;t know the reason. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. On the other hand, data with only single-byte characters works fine. About MAC, I don&amp;rsquo;t have it.</description>

      <description>go-rearrange and gorearrange were updated to v.1.0.1  As one of outputs, indexmode (bool) was added. If this is true, the rearranged result is output as the change of index for the source data. For example, if the source data and rearranged data are [&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;] and [&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;], respectively. The output will become [2, 1, 0].  By this, the specification for creating applications will expand.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a CLI tool to interactively rearrange a text data on a terminal.
Description Since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find CLI tools for manually rearranging text data, I created this CLI tool.
For this, at first, I created a Golang library go-rearrange.

      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.3.1  Recently, when scripts on local PC is uploaded to Google Drive as a new project, the time to create on Google became a bit long. (I think that this is due to Google Update.) Under this situation, when the script is uploaded, the timeout error occurs while the new project is created using the script. So the time until timeout of fetch was modified from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.</description>

      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.2.2  For Google Docs (spreadsheet, document, slide and drawing), since I noticed that the revision files would not be able to be retrieved using Drive API v3, I modified this using new workaround.  The new workaround is to use Drive API v2. drive.revisions.get of Drive API v2 can retrieve not only the revision list, but also the export links. I thought of the use of the export links.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a CLI tool to submit files to both Gist and Slack.
Description When I discuss about developing scripts, I often use Slack. When I submitted a script to Slack, I had saved the script to Gist as a backup. I had done manually this on my browser. Namely, I wanted to be saving the revision of script while I&amp;rsquo;m discussing about the script at Slack. Recently, I wished this process had been able to be automatically run.</description>

Motivation Will you want to develop GAS using CoffeeScript on your local PC?

Recently, I have wanted to have more convenient local-environment for developing GAS. So I created this &amp;ldquo;ggsrun&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Released a CLI tool for easily retrieving accesstoken from Google OAuth2. The title is gogauth. When I have seen stackoverflow, I knew that it is difficult to retrieve accesstoken from Google OAuth2. So I made this.
Features of this CLI tool are as follows.
 Retrieves easily accesstoken from Google OAuth2 for using Drive API.
 If you have PhantomeJS, this retrieves &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; from Google using it. So you don&amp;rsquo;t need to launch your browser for retrieving &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;.</description>
