      <description>Overview This is Google Apps Script library for copying folder on Google Drive.
Description I have sometimes the situation that it is required to back up the folder on Google Drive to Google Drive. But unfortunately, the method of makeCopy() of Class File and the method of Files: copy of Drive API cannot be used for directly copying the folder on Google Drive. So I created this as a library. This library can copy the folder on Google Drive.</description>

This is a sample flow for updating a file with the resumable upload using Drive API.
Sample situation: In this answer, as a sample situation, it supposes that a text file in Google Drive is updated by the resumable upload with the multiple chunks. And as the method for requesting, I use the curl command.
I prepared 2 files for 2 chunks. As the test situation, the 2 chunks of 262,144 bytes and 37,856 bytes are uploaded.</description>

Today, I noticed that new Google Apps Script project of the standalone script type cannot be created by the method of Files: create in Drive API. From now, in order to manage the Google Apps Script project, only Google Apps Script API is required to be used. By this, the following issues are brought.
 When the new standalone GAS project is created in the specific folder by uploading the local script, the following flow is required to be run.</description>

These are 3 sample scripts for moving a file to the specific folder in Google Drive using Google Apps Script.
Sample script 1 In this script, only Drive Service is used.
var sourceFileId = &amp;#34;###&amp;#34;;var destinationFolderId = &amp;#34;###&amp;#34;;var file = DriveApp.getFileById(sourceFileId);DriveApp.getFolderById(destinationFolderId).addFile(file);file.getParents().next().removeFile(file);Sample script 2 In this script, only Drive API at Advanced Google services. (In this case, it&#39;s Drive API v2.)
var sourceFileId = &amp;#34;###&amp;#34;;var destinationFolderId = &amp;#34;###&amp;#34;;Drive.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a sample script for downloading files from Google Drive by the one time download method.
Description When you download a file from Google Drive, in generally, the login and the access token are required. If you want to download the file without the authorization for the simple situation, the file is required to be publicly shared. But the file might not be able to be shared publicly, because of various reasons.</description>

ggsrun is also a CLI application for using Google Drive.
Here, I would like to introduce a sample command. This is a sample command for uploading a file to a shared folder using ggsrun.
This situation supposes that the shared folder is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/abcdefg?usp=sharing and the folder has the edit permission.
Sample command: $ ggsrun u -f &amp;#34;sample.txt&amp;#34; -p &amp;#34;abcdefg&amp;#34; --serviceaccount &amp;#34;###JSON file of Service Account###&amp;#34; If you have already used OAuth2, you can upload the file by ggsrun u -f &amp;quot;sample.</description>
