      <description>Overview This is a Google Apps Script for notifying with email when Netatmo was down.
Description I&amp;rsquo;m measuring the surrounding environment using Netatmo. There were little that my Netatmo was down so far. But recently, my Netatmo is sometimes down. It is considered that the reason is due to the thermal runaway, because the recent Japan is very hot. When Netatmo was down, users can know it by logging in using the browser and/or running the mobile application.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a CLI tool to retrieve data from a personal weather station of Netatmo.
Description I have a personal weather station of Netatmo. I check the data of my local environment using it. In most case, I have used my browser to retrieve the data so far. About retrieving data using curl, I have created it before. Recently, I thought that I wanted to create this as a CLI too.</description>
