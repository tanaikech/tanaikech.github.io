Consumer (personal) version of Google+ is closed on April 2, 2019. By this, Apps Script community of Google+ is also closed. This is one of important communities for discussing. So in this post, I would like to introduce the other communities related to Google Apps Script.
 As the next community of Apps Script community of Google+, Google Apps Script Community was launched.
 This is also introduced at How to get help of official site like this.</description>
