The parameter &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; gives various information which is selected to us. This is one of important parameters. And this can be used at Google Apps Script (GAS) although that version is v2. About how to use it, there are some documents. But it is difficult to find how to use it at GAS.</description>
