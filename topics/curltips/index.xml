When I saw the official document of &amp;ldquo;Add video and phone conferences to events&amp;rdquo;, in the current stage, I can see only the sample script for Javascript.

So I published the sample scripts for creating new event with Google Meet link to Google Calendar using various languages.</description>

This is a sample flow for updating a file with the resumable upload using Drive API.
Sample situation: In this answer, as a sample situation, it supposes that a text file in Google Drive is updated by the resumable upload with the multiple chunks. And as the method for requesting, I use the curl command.
I prepared 2 files for 2 chunks. As the test situation, the 2 chunks of 262,144 bytes and 37,856 bytes are uploaded.</description>
