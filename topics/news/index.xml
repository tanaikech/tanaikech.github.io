In my environment, at February 7, 2020, when I opened the script editor of Google Apps Script, the following notification could be seen.
By this, I could notice that finally, the V8 Runtime has already been added to Google Apps Script. I think that this will be also the great news for a lot of users including me.
The detail of V8 Runtime can be seen at https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime.</description>

At April 8, 2019, the specification of Google Apps Script Project was changed. Various specification was changed. Please see the detail at Google Cloud Platform Projects. Here, I would like to introduce one change which might be useful for users. The official document says as follows.
 When you enable an advanced service for your script project in the Apps Script editor, it is automatically enabled in the default GCP project when the script project is saved.</description>
