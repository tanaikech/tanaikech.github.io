Description When I create applications for using Google Drive, I often retrieve a file list from a folder in the application. So far, I had created the script for retrieving a file list from a folder for each application. Recently, I thought that if there is the script for retrieving the file list with the folder tree from the folder of Google Drive as a module, it will be useful for me and other users.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving a folder tree using Node.js. In this sample, you can set the top of folder for the folder tree.

But when Drive API is used for this situation, if there are a lot of folders in the top folder, a lot of APIs are required to be called.</description>

Here, I introduce 2 scripts for uploading files to Slack using Node.js as samples. These 2 sample scripts are for uploading files to Slack.
Sample script 1:  You can upload the zip file by converting byte array as follows.  At first, it builds form-data. Adds the zip file converted to byte array and boundary using Buffer.concat(). This is used as body in request.    Basically, this is almost the same to the method using GAS.</description>

      <description>Abstract I have already reported that the pyramid method is one of very effectively algolithms for summing string elements in an array using Google Apps Script (GAS). This report describes the adaptability of the pyramid method to any languages except for GAS. c++ (g++), Go, Java, Javascript on Node.js, Python and Ruby were chosen as the sample languages. In those languages, there are languages which have the distinctive commands for summing the array elements.</description>
