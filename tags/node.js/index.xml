      <description>This sample supposes as follows. So please confirm it.
 quickstart is used and default quickstart works fine.  In order to use this sample, please carry out as follows.
 Replace listFiles() of the default quickstart to this sample. Set folderid. This script can retrieve files in the folder with folderid. Delete drive-nodejs-quickstart.json. I think that there is the file at .credentials in your home directory. Change the SCOPE from var SCOPES = [&#39;https://www.</description>

Here, I introduce 2 scripts for uploading files to Slack using Node.js as samples. These 2 sample scripts are for uploading files to Slack.
Sample script 1:  You can upload the zip file by converting byte array as follows.  At first, it builds form-data. Adds the zip file converted to byte array and boundary using Buffer.concat(). This is used as body in request.   Basically, this is almost the same to the method using GAS.</description>

Abstract I have already reported that the pyramid method is one of very effectively algolithms for summing string elements in an array using Google Apps Script (GAS). This report describes the adaptability of the pyramid method to any languages except for GAS. c++ (g++), Go, Java, Javascript on Node.js, Python and Ruby were chosen as the sample languages. In those languages, there are languages which have the distinctive commands for summing the array elements.</description>
