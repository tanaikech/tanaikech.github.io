      <description>Overview This is a python library to manage the tables on Google Document using Google Docs API.
Description Google Docs API has been released. When I used this API, I found that it is very difficult for me to manage the tables on Google Document using Google Docs API. Although I checked the official document, unfortunately, I thought that it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult for me. So in order to easily manage the tables on Google Document, I created this library.</description>

This is a sample script for creating new table and putting values to cells using Google Docs API with Google Apps Script. Unfortunately, in the current stage, although I had been looking for the method for creating a table and putting the values in each cell at the official document, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find. Google Docs API is growing now. So such documents might be not prepared yet. By this situation, I investigated about the method for achieving this method.</description>

When an image is inserted to Google Docs (Spreadsheet, Document and Slides) using the method of insertImage using Google Apps Script, there is the case that the error occurs. The error messages are &amp;ldquo;server error&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;invalid image data&amp;rdquo;. Here, I would like to introduce the limitations for inserting images to Google Docs. As the result, it was found that the limitation is due to both the mimeTypes and the area of image rather than the file size.</description>

This is a script for modifying the shading color of paragraph on Google Document using Google Apps Script.
Recently, by releasing Google Docs API, the shading color got to be able to be modified using the script. Here, I would like to introduce a sample script for modifying the shading color of the paragraph on Google Document. At the current Document Service, the shading color cannot be modified yet.</description>

This is a sample script for replacing text to image for Google Document using Google Apps Script (GAS). There is a method for replacing text to text at Class Text of DocumentApp. But there are not methods for replacing text to image. So I created this sample script.
Demo : This sample image was created by k3-studio.
Usage : replaceTextToImage(body, replaceText, image, width);   body : body of document.</description>

There are no prepared methods for retrieving the number of lines in the Google Document. So I thought this workaround. If the end of each line can be detected, the number of lines can be retrieved. So I tried to add the end markers of each line using OCR.
At Google Documents, when a sentence is over the page width, the sentence automatically has the line break. But the line break has no \r\n or \n.</description>
