This sample script is for uploading CSV file as Spreadsheet and modifying permissions using Golang.
I think that the detail information of google-api-go-client is a bit little. The sample scripts are so little. It retrieves most information from only godoc and GitHub. So I publish such sample scripts here. If this is useful for you, I&#39;m glad.
Important points :  Give mimeType of file that it wants to upload to options of Media(r io.</description>
