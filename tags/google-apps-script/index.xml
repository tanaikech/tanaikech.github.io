      <description>Gists
Description This script provides a simple example for generating Text-To-Speech (TTS) using the Gemini API within Google Apps Script. The Gemini API generates audio data in the audio/L16;codec=pcm;rate=24000 format, which is not directly playable. Since there&amp;rsquo;s no built-in method to convert this to a standard audio/wav format, this sample script includes a custom function to handle the conversion.
Limitations and Considerations  The provided convertL16ToWav_ function is specifically designed for the audio/L16;codec=pcm;rate=24000 MIME type.</description>

      <description>Gists
Abstract The Gemini API traditionally required specific prompts for desired output formats. This report explores two new GenerationConfig properties: &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;response_schema&amp;rdquo;. These allow developers to directly specify formats like JSON, enhancing control and predictability. We analyze and compare the effectiveness of both properties for controlling Gemini API output formats.
Introduction One of the key challenges when working with the Gemini API is ensuring the output data is delivered in the format your application requires.</description>

      <description>Gists
Abstract This report explores controlling output formats for the Gemini API. Traditionally, prompts dictated the format. A new property, &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo;, allows specifying the format (e.g., JSON) directly. Testing confirms this property improves control over output format, especially for complex JSON schemas. The recommended approach is to combine a detailed JSON schema with &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo; for clear and consistent outputs.
Introduction One of the key challenges when working with the Gemini API is ensuring the output data is in the format your application requires.</description>

This is a sample script for managing the row height and the column width of a table on Google Slides using Google Apps Script.
In the current stage, Google Slides service (SlidesApp) cannot manage the row height and the column width of the table on Google Slides, while the table width and height can be managed. But, fortunately, when Google Slides API is used, this can be achieved.
In this post, I would like to introduce a sample script for managing the row height and the column width of a table on Google Slides using Google Apps Script.</description>

This is a sample script for exporting Google Documents as HTML with the image hyperlinks using Google Apps Script.
Recently, it seems that the specification for exporting Google Documents as HTML data has been changed. When a Google Document are exported as HTML data before, the images in the Google Document were the image hyperlinks, which are publicly shared. But, in the current stage, when a Google Document is exported as HTML data, the images in the Google Document are the data URL (base64 data) of the images.</description>

      <description>Gists
When a value is searched from the 1-dimensional array and a 2-dimensional array, after V8 runtime could be used, I use JSON object, Set object, and Map Object. But, I had never measured the process cost of this situation. In this post, I would like to introduce the process cost for searching a value using a JSON object, Set object, and Map object converted from the 1-dimensional array and 2-dimensional array.</description>

Updated on July 8, 2023
In the current stage, unfortunately, the built-in methods of Google Apps Script cannot directly retrieve the values from the XLSX data. From this situation, I have created DocsServiceApp. When this Google Apps Script library is used, the values are directly retrieved from XLSX data by parsing XML data of XLSX data.
Here, as another approach, I would like to introduce a sample script for directly retrieving the values from XLSX data using SheetJS with Google Apps Script.</description>

Introduction At Stackoverflow, a lot of people post questions and answers to the questions every day. There are various tags in Stackoverflow. A lot of discussions are performed at each tag. Their discussions bring important information and are much useful for a lot of people. As one of the tags, there is &amp;ldquo;google-apps-script&amp;rdquo;. I sometimes discuss the questions with that tag. When we see the discussions, we can notice that the discussions are changed and progressed over time, because &amp;ldquo;Google Apps Script&amp;rdquo; which is the origin of the tag is updated.</description>

This sample script decrypts the salted base64 data of finance.yahoo.com using Google Apps Script.
Recently, when I saw the HTML of finance.yahoo.com, I noticed that the data is converted by the salted base64. In order to decrypt the data, it is required to use the key data. But, unfortunately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the key data from the HTML. When I searched for it, I found this thread. From the thread, I could retrieve the key data.</description>

This is a sample script for encrypting and decrypting with AES using crypto-js with Google Apps Script.
Unfortunately, in the current stage, Google Apps Script cannot encrypt and decrypt AES using the built-in functions. In this post, in order to achieve this, &amp;ldquo;crypto-js&amp;rdquo; is used from cdnjs.com ( https://cdnjs.com/libraries/crypto-js ). In the current stage, it seems that the main functions of crypto-js.min.js can be directly used with Google Apps Script.</description>

This report is a workaround for reflecting the latest Google Apps Script to the deployed Web Apps without redeploying.
Pattern 1 Of course, when the developer mode of https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/dev is used, the latest script can be used without redeploying.
But, in this case, only the permitted users can use it using the access token. when you want to achieve this using the endpoint of https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec without the access token, in order to reflect the latest script to Web Apps, it is required to redeploy.</description>

This is a workaround for checking the existence of file ID in Google Drive without both the access token and API key.
When you want to check whether the file of the file ID is existing in Google Drive, generally, you might use Drive API and Drive service (DriveApp) of Google Apps Script. In this case, the scope of Drive API is required to be used. By this, the access token and the API key (in the case of publicly shared files) are required to be used.</description>

Abstract In Google Apps Script, there is the Web Apps. When Web Apps is used, the users can execute Google Apps Script using HTML and Javascript. This can be applied to various applications. When the Web Apps is deployed with &amp;ldquo;Anyone&amp;rdquo;, anyone can access the Web Apps. And, there is the case that Web Apps deployed with &amp;ldquo;Anyone&amp;rdquo; is required to be used. Under this condition, when 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) can be implemented, it is considered that the security can be higher and it leads to giving various directions for the applications using Web Apps.</description>

      <description>BatchRequest was updated to v1.2.0.   v1.2.0 (September 30, 2022)
 A new method of getBatchPath(name, version) was added. After August 12, 2020, in order to use batch requests, the batch path is required to be used to the endpoint of the batch requests. And, the batch path is sometimes updated. So, when a constant batch path has been continued to be used, this might lead to the reason for an error.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving the named functions from Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script.
Recently, the named functions got to be able to be used in Google Spreadsheet. Ref When several named functions are added, I thought that I wanted to retrieve these functions using a script. But, unfortunately, in the current stage, it seems that there are no built-in methods (SpreadsheetApp and Sheets API) for directly retrieving the named functions.</description>

These are sample scripts for removing the vertical borders of a table in Google Document using Google Apps Script.
Unfortunately, in the current stage, only the vertical borders cannot be removed from the table in Google Document using the Google Document service (DocumentApp). I believe that this might be resolved in the future update. But, in the current stage, when Google Docs API is used, this can be achieved. So, Google Docs API can be used as the current workaround.</description>

Introduction There is a maximum executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes. And, in the case of the custom function and the simple trigger, it is 30 seconds. Ref So users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of the scripts. Especially, it is very important to know the process costs for the array processing, because array processing is often used for spreadsheets and Google APIs.</description>

Description Google Document can use the named range. When the named range is used, the users can directly access the contents using the named range. For example, the developer can guide the users to the specific content in Google Documents using the named range. But, unfortunately, in the current stage, it seems that the named range cannot be directly used by the UI on Google Documents.</description>

This is a report for inserting the multiple paragraphs to Google Document in order using Google Docs API.
When the multiple paragraphs are inserted to Google Document using Google Docs API, it is required to pay attention to the index for inserting the texts. In this report, I would like to introduce the points for achieving this with a simple method.
Although this report uses Google Apps Script, the logic of this method can be used for other language.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a Google Apps Script library for parsing the form object from HTML form and appending the submitted values to the Spreadsheet.
Description There is Google Form in the Google service. Google Form can parse the submitted data and put it in the Spreadsheet. But when we want to use the custom form, it is required to use the HTML form on Web Apps, dialog, and sidebar. In this case, it is required to prepare Javascript and Google Apps Script for parsing the form object from the HTML form and appending the parsed values to Spreadsheet.</description>

 CellImageBuilder: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/cell-image-builder CellImage: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/cell-image  Unfortunately, in the current stage, it seems that the image manually put to a cell without using the URL cannot still be retrieved.
 When an image is manually put from URL and Google Drive to a cell, this image cannot be retrieved. When an image is put using setSourceUrl method with a script, this image and URL cannot be retrieved.</description>

This is a workaround for converting the range ID to the range object on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script.
When the named range is put to a cell as the hyperlink as follows,
the hyperlink is like #rangeid=123456789. When this link is clicked, it moves to the cells of the named range. So it is considered that this value of #rangeid=123456789 includes the information about the range of the named range.</description>

 Create Web Apps created by Google Apps Script and deploy it as Web Apps. As the returned value, the XML data is returned.  Your script can be included in this script.   User put a formula of =IMPORTML(&amp;quot;WebApps URL&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;xpath&amp;quot;) to a cell.</description>

Of course, this method can be also used for Google Document and Google Spreadsheet.</description>

This is a sample script for cropping images in the Google Slides using Google Apps Script. In the current stage, in order to crop the images in Google Slides, it is required to use replace(blobSource, crop) Because, although there is the &amp;ldquo;cropProperties&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;UpdateImagePropertiesRequest&amp;rdquo; in Slides API, unfortunately, in the current stage, this cannot be still used. This has already been reported. Ref
About cropping using replace(blobSource, crop), I thought that how to use might be a bit difficult.</description>

This is an important point for using reduceRignt with and without v8 runtime for Google Apps Script.
Sample script function myFunction() {  var array = [&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;d&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;e&amp;#34;];  var res = array.reduceRight(function (ar, e, i) {  ar.push([e, i]);  return ar;  }, []);  Logger.log(res); } Result With V8 When V8 runtime is used, the following result is obtained.
[[&amp;#34;e&amp;#34;,4],[&amp;#34;d&amp;#34;,3],[&amp;#34;c&amp;#34;,2],[&amp;#34;b&amp;#34;,1],[&amp;#34;a&amp;#34;,0]] Without V8 When V8 runtime is NOT used, the following result is obtained.</description>

This is a sample script for adjusting the text length to fit in the cell width on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. In this case, in order to fit to the cell width, the font size is changed.
Issue and workaround: Unfortunately, in the current stage, there are no methods for automatically resize the font size for fitting in the cell width in the Spreadsheet service. So in this case, it is required to think of the workaround.</description>

Description This is a sample script for disabling the buttons put on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script.
When a script is run by clicking a button on Google Spreadsheet, there is the case that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to make users run the script in duplicate. This sample script achieves this situation.
Demo In this demonstration, 2 types of buttons are used. Those are the drawing and image, respectively. When the button is clicked, the worker of 10 seconds is run.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a proposal of the enhanced custom function for Google Spreadsheet using Web Apps as the wrapper.
Demo Description When the custom function is used, in the current specification, the most methods except several methods (for example, one of them is UrlFetchApp.) that the authorization is required cannot be used. So for example, when the filenames in the folder are retrieved from the folder name, unfortunately, this cannot be directly achieved.</description>

Abstract This is a report for detecting quickly checked checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. It supposes that when the checkbox is checked, a function of Google Apps Script is run by the event trigger. In this case, when the multiple checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet are checked quickly, the script cannot be run for all checked checkboxes, because of the response speed of the event trigger. It is considered that to understand the response of event trigger is useful for creating the application for Spreadsheet.</description>

Description I have sometimes the situation that it is required to back up the folder on Google Drive to Google Drive. But unfortunately, the method of makeCopy() of Class File and the method of Files: copy of Drive API cannot be used for directly copying the folder on Google Drive. So I created this as a library.

onSelectionChange has been released at April 22, 2020. But this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be used at the released day. But now, I could confirm that this got to be able to be used. So in order to test this event trigger, I prepared a simple sample script. This is a sample script for detecting the change tab on Google Spreadsheet using onSelectionChange Event Trigger with Google Apps Script.
Demo Usage  Please copy and paste the following script to the container-bound script of Google Spreadsheet, and save the script.</description>

This is a sample script for modifying the revisions of a file on Google Drive using Google Apps Script. This script can be used for not only Google Docs files, but also the files except for Google Docs.
Issue and workaround: Unfortunately, in the current stage, at Google Docs files, the revision of Google Docs cannot be directly changed by APIs with a script. So as one of several workarounds, I would like to propose to overwrite the Google Docs file using the exported data.</description>

Introduction Please be careful! This result can be only used for Google Apps Script.
There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes for Consumer and Google Apps free edition, and 30 minutes for G Suite and Early Access. 1 So many users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of scripts. So it is very important to know the process cost of various situations.</description>

In this report, I would like to introduce the method for running functions by directly specifying the function names with Web Apps for Google Apps Script.
Description It has already been known that the directly specified functions in the project can be run from the outside by enabling &amp;ldquo;API executable&amp;rdquo; and using the method of scripts.run in Google Apps Script API. In this case, the installation for using Apps Script API is a bit complicate.</description>

This is a sample script for parsing HTML using Google Apps Script. When HTML data is converted to Google Document, the HTML data can be parsed and be converted to Google Document. In this case, the paragraphs, lists and tables are included. From this situation, I thought that this situation can be used for parsing HTML using Google Apps Script. So I could came up with this method.
In the Sheet API, the HTML data can be put to the Spreadsheet with the PasteDataRequest.</description>

When the methods of getLastRow() and getLastColumn() of Class Range for Spreadsheet are used, the last coordinates of the vertical and horizontal data range can be retrieved. When users want to retrieve the last coordinates of each row and column, there are no methods. So I created this script. I think that there are several scripts for this situation.</description>

Introduction Here I would like to introduce about the limitation of images for inserting to Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script (GAS). When you want to insert the images to Spreadsheet using GAS, insertImage() of class Sheet is usually used for this situation. At this time, an error sometimes occurs. This indicates that there is the limitation for inserting images to Spreadsheet. So I investigated the limitation.
As a result, it was found that the limitation depends on the image area (pixels^2) rather than the file size of it.</description>

There are no prepared methods for retrieving the number of lines in the Google Document. So I thought this workaround. If the end of each line can be detected, the number of lines can be retrieved. So I tried to add the end markers of each line using OCR.
At Google Documents, when a sentence is over the page width, the sentence automatically has the line break. But the line break has no \r\n or \n.</description>

Benchmark: Search for Array Processing using Google Apps Script Kanshi Tanaike
Introduction Please be careful! This result can be only used for Google Apps Script.
There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes.1 So users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of the scripts. Especially, it is very important to know the process cost for the array processing, because the array processing is often used for spreadsheet and Google APIs.</description>

This sample script retrieves the difference elements between 2 dimensional arrays using Google Apps Script. In Google Apps Script, 2 dimensional arrays are often used at Google Docs and Google APIs. And from my recent report, it has already found that the process cost of filter() is the lowest in the other loop methods. So I use the script like this.
var ar1 = [[&amp;#34;a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c1&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c2&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c3&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a4&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b4&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c4&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c5&amp;#34;]]; var ar2 = [[&amp;#34;a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c2&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c5&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c3&amp;#34;]];  var res = ar1.</description>

Description : This sample script is for retrieving emails which replied for received mails. Because there are no samples which confirm whether the owner (me) replied to the received mails, I created this. The point is as follows.
 When there are more than 2 messages in a thread, there might be a possibility to have replied. For more than 2 messages in a thread  The email address of &amp;ldquo;from&amp;rdquo; for the 1st message is the sender&amp;rsquo;s address.</description>

Description There are Class SpreadsheetApp and Class DocumentApp for operating spreadsheet and document, respectively. But there is no Class for operating GAS project. If there is such Class ProjectApp, GAS project can be directly operated by GAS script. I thought that this will lead to new applications, and created ProjectApp.</description>

There is the bathing requests in the Google APIs. The bathing requests can use the several API calls as a single HTTP request. By using this, for example, users can modify filenames of a lot of files on Google Drive. But there are limitations for the number of API calls which can process in one batch request. For example, Drive API can be used the maximum of 100 calls in one batch request.</description>

 Added new option for downloading &amp;lsquo;bound-scripts&amp;rsquo; of Google Sheets, Docs, or Forms file.  When the bound-scripts are downloaded, the project name cannot be retrieved because Drive API cannot be used for the bound-scripts. So when the bound-scripts are downloaded, the project ID had been used previously. Such filename is not easily to be seen. By this additional option, users can give the filename when it downloads the bound-scripts.</description>

      <description>RearrangeScripts was published as an add-on application Recently, I have reported RearrangeScripts for rearranging scripts in a GAS project. At that time, I got messages and mails from many developers. They said that you should publish this as an add-on. So, this was released. Now you can search &amp;ldquo;RearrangeScripts&amp;rdquo; as an add-on for Spreadsheet. If this is helpful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m happy.

This is a document for explaining the difference between given values and retrieved values for shapes on Google Slides. When a shape is created to a slide using Slides API, most users give the size of height and width as pt. When the size is retrieved from the created shape as pt, the size is often difference from the given size.
For example, when a square shape is created by giving the height and width of 100 pt, the size which is retrieved from the created square becomes 99.</description>

Introduction By recent Google update (Google update at October 24, 2017), various new winds to GAS developers were blown. There is &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; as one of the new winds. &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; makes us manage the project using JSON. Especially, the special scopes which have to use OAuth2 process can be used by only setting them to the Manifests. I think that this is the largest modification. However, when scopes are added to a project using Manifests, users who use the project can use only added scopes.</description>

This sample script is for retrieving the size (width and height) of a table in Google Slides using Google Apps Script.
There are no methods for directly retrieving the table size using SlidesApp yet. So I thought of a workaround using Slides API.
 When the slide information is retrieved using Slides.Presentations.Pages.get() of Slides API, the information of tables is also included. In the information, the height and width of table are also included.</description>

      <description>It was found that you can also create new project with your original Manifests using ggsrun. By using this, for example, when you created new project, the project can have libraries, Advanced Google Services and so on at the initial stage. I think that this can be used as a template for Project.

This sample script is for uploading image files to Slack using Incoming Webhooks by Google Apps Script.
When users try to upload image files to Slack using Incoming Webhooks, it has been known that although the access token is required to directly upload them, Incoming Webhooks can upload them by using the tag of image_url. In this sample script, it uploads image files (BMP, GIF, JPEG and PNG) on Google Drive to Slack using Incoming Webhooks.</description>

This sample script is for retrieving files with filename included special characters using Google Apps Script. The files are used on Google Drive.
The files with filename of special characters cannot be retrieved using DriveApp.getFilesByName(). This workaround solved this.
As a query parameter, name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is used. This contains is very important. name=&#39;filename with special characters&#39; cannot retrieve such files. Today, it was found that name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is the workaround.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving images on Spreadsheet.
Unfortunately, there are no methods for retrieving directly images on spreadsheet using GAS. So I use the method which retrieves URL from =image(URL) and retrieves the image from the URL.
In this case, =image(URL) has to be in the cell. Images embedded by insertImage() cannot be retrieved.
At first, please confirm them.
Sample script : var cell = &amp;#34;A1&amp;#34;; // Cell address with the function of &amp;#34;=image()&amp;#34; var filename = &amp;#34;samplename&amp;#34;; // Output filename  var image = SpreadsheetApp.</description>

      <description>This sample script is for searching route between place A and B and embedding a map by custom function on Spreadsheet.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When the map is embedded to a cell on spreadsheet as an image, the function =IMAGE() is suitable for this situation. However, Class Maps, setFormula() for importing =IMAGE() and DriveApp.createFile() for creating images from maps also cannot be used for custom functions.</description>

      <description>Description There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). It&amp;rsquo;s 6 minutes. So users have to pay attention to the process cost of the script. GAS can use JavaScript 1.7. This means to be able to be used comprehension for GAS.
In this report, the process cost for the comprehension has been investigated. The normal for loop was used as the competitor. As a result, it was found that the comprehension can be used one of methods for reducing the process cost.</description>

It was found as follows.
 User information retrieving by Class Session is the owner and users which installed triggers by themselves. When each user installs a trigger, user information retrieving by Class Session losts the accuracy. So user information has to be retrieved using a temporally installed trigger. Using onOpen(), it cannot directly install triggers and authorize.</description>

Motivation Will you want to develop GAS using CoffeeScript on your local PC? Generally, when we develop GAS, we have to login to Google using own browser and develop it using Javascript on the Script Editor. Recently, I have wanted to have more convenient local-environment for developing GAS. So I created this &amp;ldquo;ggsrun&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>There are a lot of APIs on Google. When we use Google Drive APIs, they usually have &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; as a resource. The parameter &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; gives various information which is selected to us. This is one of important parameters. And this can be used at Google Apps Script (GAS) although that version is v2. About how to use it, there are some documents. But it is difficult to find how to use it at GAS.</description>
