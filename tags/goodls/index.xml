      <description>v2.0.5 (March 10, 2023)
 From this version, when the API key is used, the large file is downloaded by the API key. Because the specification for downloading the shared large file is sometimes changed. When the API key is not used, the shared large file is downloaded by the current specification (v2.0.4). If the shared large file cannot be downloaded by the change of the specification on Google&amp;rsquo;s side, please use the API key and test it again.</description>

      <description>v2.0.4 (March 9, 2023) From January 2024, it seems that the specification of the process for downloading a large shared file on Google Drive has been changed. So I updated goodls to reflect this. The usage of goodls has not changed. In the current stage, when a large share file is downloaded, it is required to click the following button. &amp;lt;form id=&amp;#34;download-form&amp;#34; action=&amp;#34;https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download&amp;#34; method=&amp;#34;get&amp;#34; &amp;gt; &amp;lt;input type=&amp;#34;submit&amp;#34; id=&amp;#34;uc-download-link&amp;#34; class=&amp;#34;goog-inline-block jfk-button</description>
