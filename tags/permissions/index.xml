      <description>Today, I could confirm that the transfer of owner of files got to be able to be achieved with batch requests of Drive API. When I had tested this at January 31, 2020, an error of there is no function to change the owner of this item yet (currently under development) had occurred.
But today, I could confirm that this got to be able to be achieved by the batch requests.</description>

      <description>Gists
This sample script is for uploading CSV file as Spreadsheet and modifying permissions using Golang.
I think that the detail information of google-api-go-client is a bit little. The sample scripts are so little. It retrieves most information from only godoc and GitHub. So I publish such sample scripts here. If this is useful for you, I&#39;m glad.
Important points :  Give mimeType of file that it wants to upload to options of Media(r io.</description>
