      <description>At July 7, 2020, I have reported the transfer of owner of files got not to be able to be achieved with batch requests of Drive API. Ref But today, I could confirm that this got to be able to be achieved.
But, I&amp;rsquo;m worry about the possibility that this might not be able to be used in the future again.</description>

      <description>At 15, June 2020, I have reported the transfer of owner of files got to be able to be achieved with batch requests of Drive API. Ref And also, yesterday (06, July 2020), I could have confirmed that this could be worked. But, now (07, July 2020), the following response is returned.
{  &amp;#34;error&amp;#34;: {  &amp;#34;errors&amp;#34;: [  {  &amp;#34;domain&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;global&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;reason&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;invalidSharingRequest&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;message&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Bad Request.</description>

      <description>Today, I could confirm that the transfer of owner of files got to be able to be achieved with batch requests of Drive API. When I had tested this at January 31, 2020, an error of there is no function to change the owner of this item yet (currently under development) had occurred.
But today, I could confirm that this got to be able to be achieved by the batch requests.</description>

      <description>Gists
This sample script is for uploading CSV file as Spreadsheet and modifying permissions using Golang.
I think that the detail information of google-api-go-client is a bit little. The sample scripts are so little. It retrieves most information from only godoc and GitHub. So I publish such sample scripts here. If this is useful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
Important points :  Give mimeType of file that it wants to upload to options of Media(r io.</description>
