Overview This is a report about the possibility of asynchronous process using event triggers. This is for Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description onEdit() which is a simple trigger is often used as a trigger when the values are modified on Spreadsheet. When users want to use the script including some methods which are required to be authorized as the onEdit event, a installable trigger of onEdit is used.</description>

      <description>This sample script sends an e-mail, when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4. When you use this sample, please create a container bound script with spreadsheet which is edited by Sheet API. And please input your e-mail and run firstly a method of createTrigger(). By this, a trigger is installed as onChange(). After this, edit spreadsheet from outside by Sheet API v4.
When when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4, I used sendEmail() as a sample, because script editor is closed.</description>
