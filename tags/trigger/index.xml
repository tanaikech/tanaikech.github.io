onSelectionChange has been released at April 22, 2020. But this couldn&#39;t be used at the released day. But now, I could confirm that this got to be able to be used. So in order to test this event trigger, I prepared a simple sample script. This is a sample script for detecting the change tab on Google Spreadsheet using onSelectionChange Event Trigger with Google Apps Script.
Demo Usage  Please copy and paste the following script to the container-bound script of Google Spreadsheet, and save the script.</description>

Overview This is a report about the possibility of asynchronous process using event triggers. This is for Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description onEdit() which is a simple trigger is often used as a trigger when the values are modified on Spreadsheet. When users want to use the script including some methods which are required to be authorized as the onEdit event, a installable trigger of onEdit is used.</description>

      <description>This sample script sends an e-mail, when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4. When you use this sample, please create a container bound script with spreadsheet which is edited by Sheet API. And please input your e-mail and run firstly a method of createTrigger(). By this, a trigger is installed as onChange(). After this, edit spreadsheet from outside by Sheet API v4.
When when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4, I used sendEmail() as a sample, because script editor is closed.</description>
