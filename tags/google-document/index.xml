      <description>Gists
This is sample scripts for modifying the 1st-page header in Google Document using Google Apps Script. Unfortunately, in the current stage, the 1st-page header cannot be modified by Document service. In this case, it is required to use Google Docs API. Here, I would like to introduce 2 sample scripts for modifying the 1st page header using Docs API.
When you use this, please enable Google Docs API at Advanced Google services.</description>
