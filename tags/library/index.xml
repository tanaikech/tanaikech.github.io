Introduction By recent Google update (Google update at October 24, 2017), various new winds to GAS developers were blown. There is &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; as one of the new winds. &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; makes us manage the project using JSON. Especially, the special scopes which have to use OAuth2 process can be used by only setting them to the Manifests. I think that this is the largest modification. However, when scopes are added to a project using Manifests, users who use the project can use only added scopes.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a GAS application for rearranging Google Apps Scripts (GAS) in a project which can be seen at the script editor.
Description Have you ever thought about rearranging Google Apps Scripts in a project which can be seen at the script editor? I also have thought about it. Finally, I could find the workaround to do it. And recently, I have given this function to ggsrun which is a CLI tool.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a Manifests library for Google Apps Scripts.
Description By recent update of Google, Manifests was added to Google Apps Script Project. At the moment I saw the detail, I thought that this Manifests will blow a new wind for a lot of GAS developers. So I created this.
This library makes users easily access Manifests using Google Apps Script. If this was useful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a GAS project library for Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description There are Class SpreadsheetApp and Class DocumentApp for operating spreadsheet and document, respectively. But there is no Class for operating GAS project. If there is the Class ProjectApp, GAS project can be directly operated by GAS script. I thought that this will lead to new applications, and created ProjectApp.
On the other hand, as a CLI tool for operating GAS project, there has already been ggsrun.</description>

      <description>OnedriveApp was updated to v1.0.2.
Moved the instance of PropertiesService.getScriptProperties() to outside of this library. When there is the PropertiesService.getScriptProperties() inside the library, it was found that the parameters that users set was saved to the library. So this was modified. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t notice this situation.

      <description>ImgApp was updated to v1.1.0. New method was added.
2. doResize() Overview This method is for resizing images.
Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to resize images at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and resizes the image using setWidth() and setHeight(). But in this method, the resized blob cannot be retrieved. So although I had thought of other workaround, I had not been able to find it.</description>

      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2017/06/27/gas-library-imgapp-getsize/</guid>
      <description>1. getSize() Overview This method is for retrieving the width and height of image as the unit of pixel.
Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to directly retrieve the image size at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and retrieves the size using getWidth() and getHeight(). But in this method, it uses much time and resources on Google. So I thought of retrieving the information of image at the binary level, and created this.</description>

      <title>Updated: GAS Library - SOUWA</title>

      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2017/06/19/updated-gas-library-souwa/</guid>
      <description>SOUWA means summing in Japanese. SOUWA can sum string elements in an array at the high speed. The speed of SOUWA with the pyramid algorithm is about 380 times faster than that of the standard method. New algorithm for summing array elements was developed for SOUWA. You can see the detailed report of this library at here. If you are interested in this, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
It was updated to v1.0.2. Please check it out.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had been looking for creating an image from coordinate data. Unfortunately I have never found them. So I made this. This Google Apps Script (GAS) library creates an image file from coordinate data.
You can see the detail information at https://github.com/tanaikech/CreateImg.
There is a part where I would like to improve in this library. That&amp;rsquo;s convByteSlice(). I think that there is the method to be faster about the part.</description>

      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2016/10/30/python-library-souwapy/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;souwapy&amp;rdquo; is a library for summing array elements with high speed by new algorithm (Pyramid method). The speed is faster than csv and panbdas module of python and v8 engine of node.js. The souwapy module is 2.3 and 3.1 times faster than csv and pandas module, respectively. This was really surprised me. It was found that the theory was correct.
At first, I have created this theory for Google Apps Script.</description>
