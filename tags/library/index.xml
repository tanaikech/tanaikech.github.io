      <description>Gists
Abstract This article introduces a Node.js wrapper that dramatically reduces the startup time for the Gemini CLI when used with MCP servers built on Google Apps Script. This optimization enhances user experience by accelerating the initialization process, achieving a speed boost of approximately 15 times.
1. Introduction The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a vital open standard enabling AI agents to connect with external tools and data sources for complex, real-world tasks.</description>

      <description>MCPApp was updated to v2.0.7   v2.0.7 (August 6, 2025)
  Starting with v2.0.7, you can now selectively enable or disable the LockService.
 By default, this library runs with the LockService enabled. To disable it, simply modify return new MCPApp.mcpApp({ accessKey: &amp;quot;sample&amp;quot; }) to return new MCPApp.mcpApp({ accessKey: &amp;quot;sample&amp;quot;, lock: false }). When the LockService is disabled (lock: false), asynchronous requests from clients like the Gemini CLI may see an increase in processing speed.</description>

 At Gemini CLI v0.1.15, prompts/list was called even when prompts wasn&amp;rsquo;t included in capabilities. This resulted in the error Error discovering prompts from gas_web_apps: MCP error -32001: Request timed out when prompts wasn&amp;rsquo;t returned for prompts/list. To resolve this, I updated ToolsForMCPServer to return an empty array for prompts, which eliminated the error. Consequently, with this update in v1.</description>

 When I updated Gemini CLI from v0.1.12 to v0.1.13, an issue related to the schema of MCP occurred. Ref So, as a workaround at the time, I updated this library. But when I updated Gemini CLI to v0.1.14, I confirmed that the previous schema could be used. So, I reimplemented the previous schema. By this, the request body for APIs can be directly generated using Gemini CLI v0.</description>

In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ve received emails about it, so I&amp;rsquo;ve updated ToolsForMCPServer for Gemini CLI v0.1.13.

      <description>Gists
Abstract This text introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardizing AI interaction with external systems. It explores the potential of using Google Apps Script (GAS) to host an MCP server, leveraging GAS&amp;rsquo;s integration with Google Workspace for data access. A sample script demonstrates feasibility, highlighting the current absence of an official GAS SDK. The work aims to foster understanding and encourage SDK development.
Introduction Recently, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard protocol for connecting AI applications with third-party systems and data sources.</description>

Abstract This is a Google Apps Script library for converting files from various MIME types to a specified target MIME type. The library accepts both file IDs and blobs as input values.
Introduction Recently, I encountered a scenario where I needed to convert files of various MIME types to a specific target MIME type. While converting files with known source MIME types is relatively straightforward, the process becomes more complex when the source MIME type is unknown.</description>

      <description>GeminiWithFiles was updated to v2.0.3   v2.0.3 (November 19, 2024)
 I modified the specification of setFileIdsOrUrlsWithResumableUpload. From v2.0.3, when you use this method, please include propertiesService: PropertiesService.getScriptProperties() into the initial object as follows. Because, when PropertiesService.getScriptProperties() is used in the library, the values are put into the library. When I created Ref and Ref, I supposed that the script is used by copying and pasting instead of the library.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a Google Apps Script library for moving a folder including files and folders on Google Drive.
Description This library addresses a common challenge: efficiently moving folders, including their subfolders and files, between Google Drives. This encompasses both personal and shared drives using a script. While Google Drive offers straightforward methods for moving individual files between any drives, directly moving entire folders containing subfolders presents limitations, particularly when shared drives are involved.</description>

      <description>Overview DownloadLargeFilesByUrl is a GAS library for downloading large files from URL to Google Drive using Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description I had been thinking of about whether a large file from an URL can be downloaded to Google Drive using GAS. When I have tried to download such large files, I noticed the following limitations. These limitations are due to the specification of GAS.
 When users download a file from URL using GAS, at the most users, it retrieves the blob using UrlFetchApp.</description>

Description Have you ever thought about the concurrent processing using only native Google Apps Script (GAS)? So far, I had run the concurrent processing using golang, javascript and python. But the script cannot be used by the trigger event, because these are not native GAS. Recently, it was found that the fetchAll method added by the Google&amp;rsquo;s update at January 19, 2018 is worked by the asynchronous processing.</description>

Description There are Class SpreadsheetApp and Class DocumentApp for operating spreadsheet and document, respectively. But there is no Class for operating GAS project. If there is such Class ProjectApp, GAS project can be directly operated by GAS script. I thought that this will lead to new applications, and created ProjectApp.</description>

      <description>Gists
Introduction By recent Google update (Google update at October 24, 2017), various new winds to GAS developers were blown. There is &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; as one of the new winds. &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; makes us manage the project using JSON. Especially, the special scopes which have to use OAuth2 process can be used by only setting them to the Manifests. I think that this is the largest modification. However, when scopes are added to a project using Manifests, users who use the project can use only added scopes.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m sorry that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t notice this situation.

2. doResize() Overview This method is for resizing images.
Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to resize images at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and resizes the image using setWidth() and setHeight(). But in this method, the resized blob cannot be retrieved. So although I had thought of other workaround, I had not been able to find it.</description>

Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to directly retrieve the image size at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and retrieves the size using getWidth() and getHeight(). But in this method, it uses much time and resources on Google. So I thought of retrieving the information of image at the binary level, and created this.</description>

      <description>SOUWA means summing in Japanese. SOUWA can sum string elements in an array at the high speed. The speed of SOUWA with the pyramid algorithm is about 380 times faster than that of the standard method. New algorithm for summing array elements was developed for SOUWA. You can see the detailed report of this library at here. If you are interested in this, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.

You can see the detail information at https://github.com/tanaikech/CreateImg.
There is a part where I would like to improve in this library. That&amp;rsquo;s convByteSlice(). I think that there is the method to be faster about the part.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;souwapy&amp;rdquo; is a library for summing array elements with high speed by new algorithm (Pyramid method). The speed is faster than csv and panbdas module of python and v8 engine of node.js. The souwapy module is 2.3 and 3.1 times faster than csv and pandas module, respectively. This was really surprised me. It was found that the theory was correct.
At first, I have created this theory for Google Apps Script.</description>
