By Google&amp;rsquo;s update at January 19, 2018, fetchAll method was added to the UrlFetch service. When I saw the usage, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the detail information about the actual running state. So I investigated about it.
As the result, it was found that the fetchAll method is worked by the asynchronous processing. The returned data is reordered by the order of requests. By this, it was also found that if you want to retrieve the data from the several URL, the process cost of UrlFetchApp.</description>
