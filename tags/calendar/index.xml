This is a sample script for retrieving the event ID from the event URL of Google Calendar using Google Apps Script.
The event URL is like https://www.google.com/calendar/event?###. At the event URL, ### of https://www.google.com/calendar/event?### is not the event ID. So it is required to convert it.
Sample script var eventUrl = &amp;#34;https://www.google.com/calendar/event?###&amp;#34;; var eventId = Utilities.newBlob(Utilities.base64Decode(eventUrl.split(&amp;#34;=&amp;#34;)[1]))  .getDataAsString()  .split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;)[0]; Logger.log(eventId); </description>
