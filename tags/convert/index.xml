This is a sample script for converting the SVG image data to PNG image data using Google Apps Script.
Unfortunately, in the current stage, there are no methods for directly converting the SVG to PNG in Google Drive service. But it can be achieved by Drive API. The sample script is as follows.
Before you use this, please enable Drive API at Advanced Google services.
Sample script function myFunction() {const svgFileId = &amp;#34;###&amp;#34;; // Please set the fileId of the SVG file.</description>

Overview This is a sample script which can achieve the resumable conversion from the large CSV-file to several spreadsheets by splitting the CSV file using Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description Is there a situation that you want to convert a CSV file with the large size (&amp;gt; 50 MB) to Spreadsheet? When such large CSV file is converted to Spreadsheet, you will experience the error. The reason is the size and/or also it may be due to the total cells (&amp;gt; 2,000,000 cells) of CSV file.</description>

This sample script is for uploading CSV file as Spreadsheet and modifying permissions using Golang.
I think that the detail information of google-api-go-client is a bit little. The sample scripts are so little. It retrieves most information from only godoc and GitHub. So I publish such sample scripts here. If this is useful for you, I&#39;m glad.
Important points :  Give mimeType of file that it wants to upload to options of Media(r io.</description>

This sample script is for the interconversion between Google Docs (document, spreadsheet and presentation) and Microsoft Docs (word, excel and powerpoint). The feature is to convert them without Advanced Google Services.
Since Advanced Google Services is not used for this, if you publish your script with this script, you are not necessary to explain how to install Advanced Google Services. This script converts between Google Docs and Microsoft Docs using UrlFetchApp.</description>
