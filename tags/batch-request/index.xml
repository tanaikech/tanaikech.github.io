This is a sample script for sending multiple emails using the batch request with Gmail API using Google Apps Script. When multiple emails are sent using &amp;ldquo;GmailApp.sendEmail&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;MailApp.sendEmail&amp;rdquo;, a loop is used. But in this case, the process cost becomes high. In this post, I would like to introduce the sample script for reducing the process cost under this situation. Gmail API can be requested with the batch request.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a library for running Batch Requests for Google APIs using Javascript.
Description When users use Google&#39;s APIs, one quota is used for one API call. When the batch request is used, several APIs can be called by one quota, although there are some limitations in the batch request.
google-api-javascript-client can run the batch request. Ref But, I created this for my self study. This library can achieve the batch request using fetch without using google-api-javascript-client.</description>

There is the bathing requests in the Google APIs. The bathing requests can use the several API calls as a single HTTP request. By using this, for example, users can modify filenames of a lot of files on Google Drive. But there are limitations for the number of API calls which can process in one batch request. For example, Drive API can be used the maximum of 100 calls in one batch request.</description>
