      <description>Overview DownloadLargeFilesByUrl is a GAS library for downloading large files from URL to Google Drive using Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description I had been thinking of about whether a large file from an URL can be downloaded to Google Drive using GAS. When I have tried to download such large files, I noticed the following limitations. These limitations are due to the specification of GAS.
 When users download a file from URL using GAS, at the most users, it retrieves the blob using UrlFetchApp.</description>
