Overview This is a sample script which can achieve the resumable conversion from the large CSV-file to several spreadsheets by splitting the CSV file using Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description Is there a situation that you want to convert a CSV file with the large size (&amp;gt; 50 MB) to Spreadsheet? When such large CSV file is converted to Spreadsheet, you will experience the error. The reason is the size and/or also it may be due to the total cells (&amp;gt; 2,000,000 cells) of CSV file.</description>
