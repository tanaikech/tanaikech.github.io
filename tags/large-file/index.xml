      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/tanaikech/3e44c779f05374d19333444c9a4dd5ba&#34;&gt;Gists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a sample script which can achieve the resumable conversion from the large CSV-file to several spreadsheets by splitting the CSV file using Google Apps Script (GAS).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there a situation that you want to convert a CSV file with the large size (&amp;gt; 50 MB) to Spreadsheet? When such large CSV file is converted to Spreadsheet, you will experience the error. The reason is the size and/or also it may be due to the total cells (&amp;gt; 2,000,000 cells) of CSV file. In this case, you will think that when the file is split, each file can be converted to Spreadsheet. But the blob which can be used at GAS is less than 50 MB (52,428,800 bytes). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#References&#34;&gt;Ref1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; So when you have a CSV file with more than 50 MB, it is not possible to split it. In this case, you can split such large file by files.get of Drive API. files.get of Drive API has a function of Partial download. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#References&#34;&gt;Ref2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Using this, the file can be split. By the way, in my environment, when a CSV file with the size of 100 MB is used for this sample script, when the file is split by 10 MB, about 65 seconds was required to convert a chunk to Spreadsheet. In this case, when the CSV file is completely converted, it is considered that it will be over the limitation time (6 min) for executing GAS. So in this post, I would like to introduce a sample script which can achieve the resumable conversion from the large CSV-file to several spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
