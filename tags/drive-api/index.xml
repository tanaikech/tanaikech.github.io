In this report, I would like to report about the current specification of the search query for the file list method in Drive API.
Recently, I noticed that the specification of the search query for the file list method in Drive API might have been changed. I thought that to know the change of specification of the search query is important for creating the application using Drive API. In this report, I would like to introduce the current specification of the search query.</description>

Description I had reported &amp;ldquo;Drive API cannot create Google Apps Script project no longer&amp;rdquo; before. Ref About this, I had reported the future request. Ref At July 30, 2020, I could confirm that the Google Apps Script project of the standalone type got to be able to be created by multipart/form-data using Drive API again.</description>

I have reported &amp;ldquo;Drive API cannot create Google Apps Script project no longer&amp;rdquo;. Ref About this, I had reported the future request. Ref Today, I could confirm that the Google Apps Script project of the standalone type got to be able to be created by multipart/form-data using Drive API. This is a good news for me. By this, the following 2 patterns can be used from now.
Pattern 1:  Create new standalone GAS project by Apps Script API.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving a folder tree using Node.js. In this sample, you can set the top of folder for the folder tree. In generally, the folder tree is created by retrieving folders from the top folder in order. For example, when Google Apps Script is used, the script becomes like this. But when Drive API is used for this situation, if there are a lot of folders in the top folder, a lot of APIs are required to be called.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of APIs on Google. When we use Google Drive APIs, they usually have &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; as a resource. The parameter &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; gives various information which is selected to us. This is one of important parameters. And this can be used at Google Apps Script (GAS) although that version is v2. About how to use it, there are some documents. But it is difficult to find how to use it at GAS.</description>
