      <description>Gists Abstract This article demonstrates integrating Google Maps with natural language using the Gemini CLI and an MCP server. This powerful combination allows users to automate complex location-based tasks, such as route planning and information retrieval, through simple, intuitive text-based prompts. Introduction The Gemini CLI, when paired with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, is a powerful tool for integrating various applications with natural language. When the MCP servers are built</description>

I think that this method is one of various ideas.

Solution In order to avoid these limitations, I used Web Apps.</description>
