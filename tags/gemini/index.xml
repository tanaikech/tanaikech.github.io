      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2025/11/11/gemini-cli-extension-filesearchstore-extension/</guid>
      <description>Here introduces a new Gemini CLI extension that integrates Google&amp;rsquo;s File Search feature. This tool establishes a fully managed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system directly on the command line.
The extension is designed to simplify the use of the Gemini API&amp;rsquo;s File Search, a powerful new feature that enables RAG grounded in personal or proprietary knowledge bases. While the underlying API requires scripting, this Node.js-built CLI extension allows users to seamlessly manage File Search stores and generate context-aware content grounded in their private documents without having to leave the terminal interface.</description>

Abstract This report explores an optimized approach to integrating the Gemini CLI with Google Workspace via an MCP server. Traditionally, this process requires numerous custom tools, which increases development costs. We propose leveraging the inherent JSON schema requirements of the MCP server tools to directly construct request bodies for the batchUpdate methods of the Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides APIs. This approach aims to consolidate document management into just three core tools, significantly streamlining development and offering a scalable, cost-effective solution for Google Workspace automation and broader API integrations.</description>

Abstract This report details two methods for processing files using the Gemini CLI and a Google Apps Script MCP server: direct Base64 encoding and indirect transfer via the Google Drive API using ggsrun. The direct method proved ineffective due to token limits. The recommended approach, leveraging ggsrun, allows for efficient, scalable file transfers by using file IDs instead of embedding content within the prompt, enabling advanced automation capabilities.
Introduction This report demonstrates how to efficiently process file content using the Gemini CLI integrated with an MCP (Magical Control Panel) server built on Google Apps Script Web Apps.</description>

      <description>Gists
Description This script provides a simple example for generating Text-To-Speech (TTS) using the Gemini API within Google Apps Script. The Gemini API generates audio data in the audio/L16;codec=pcm;rate=24000 format, which is not directly playable. Since there&amp;rsquo;s no built-in method to convert this to a standard audio/wav format, this sample script includes a custom function to handle the conversion.
Limitations and Considerations  The provided convertL16ToWav_ function is specifically designed for the audio/L16;codec=pcm;rate=24000 MIME type.</description>

      <description>Gists
Abstract This report investigates how Gemini handles current time information, particularly when using the Gemini API. We found that while the Gemini web interface knows the current time, the Gemini API does not inherently. Therefore, applications must explicitly provide current time information in API calls for accurate time-sensitive responses.
Introduction The rapidly advancing field of generative AI is enabling increasingly complex tasks, particularly through the use of open protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.</description>

      <description>Gists
Abstract The Gemini API traditionally required specific prompts for desired output formats. This report explores two new GenerationConfig properties: &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;response_schema&amp;rdquo;. These allow developers to directly specify formats like JSON, enhancing control and predictability. We analyze and compare the effectiveness of both properties for controlling Gemini API output formats.
Introduction One of the key challenges when working with the Gemini API is ensuring the output data is delivered in the format your application requires.</description>

      <description>Gists
Abstract This report explores controlling output formats for the Gemini API. Traditionally, prompts dictated the format. A new property, &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo;, allows specifying the format (e.g., JSON) directly. Testing confirms this property improves control over output format, especially for complex JSON schemas. The recommended approach is to combine a detailed JSON schema with &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo; for clear and consistent outputs.
