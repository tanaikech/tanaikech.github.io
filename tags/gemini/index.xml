Abstract This report proposes a novel learning method using Gemini to automate Q&amp;amp;A generation, addressing the challenges of manual Q&amp;amp;A creation. By integrating with Google tools, this approach aims to enhance learning efficiency, accessibility, and personalization while reducing costs.
Introduction Mastering a new subject often demands a significant time commitment. A proven strategy for efficient learning is through question-and-answer (Q&amp;amp;A) practice. This method typically involves constructing a dataset of pertinent Q&amp;amp;A pairs and subsequently engaging in repeated practice until desired proficiency levels are achieved.</description>

 In order to easily customize the value of &amp;ldquo;jsonSchema&amp;rdquo; for generating content with Gemini API, I added it as a new sheet of &amp;ldquo;jsonSchema&amp;rdquo; sheet in the Spreadsheet. When you customize it, you can edit the cell &amp;ldquo;A1&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;jsonSchema&amp;rdquo; sheet. By this, the script generates content with Gemini API using your customized JSON schema. The cell &amp;ldquo;A2&amp;rdquo; is the number of characters of &amp;ldquo;A1&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Abstract The Gemini API traditionally required specific prompts for desired output formats. This report explores two new GenerationConfig properties: &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;response_schema&amp;rdquo;. These allow developers to directly specify formats like JSON, enhancing control and predictability. We analyze and compare the effectiveness of both properties for controlling Gemini API output formats.

      <description>Gists
Abstract This report explores controlling output formats for the Gemini API. Traditionally, prompts dictated the format. A new property, &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo;, allows specifying the format (e.g., JSON) directly. Testing confirms this property improves control over output format, especially for complex JSON schemas. The recommended approach is to combine a detailed JSON schema with &amp;ldquo;response_mime_type&amp;rdquo; for clear and consistent outputs.
