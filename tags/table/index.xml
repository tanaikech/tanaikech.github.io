This is a sample script for creating new table and putting values to cells using Google Docs API with Google Apps Script. Unfortunately, in the current stage, although I had been looking for the method for creating a table and putting the values in each cell at the official document, I couldn&#39;t find. Google Docs API is growing now. So such documents might be not prepared yet. By this situation, I investigated about the method for achieving this method.</description>
