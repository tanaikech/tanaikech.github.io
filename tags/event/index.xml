Abstract This is a report for detecting quickly checked checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. It supposes that when the checkbox is checked, a function of Google Apps Script is run by the event trigger. In this case, when the multiple checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet are checked quickly, the script cannot be run for all checked checkboxes, because of the response speed of the event trigger. It is considered that to understand the response of event trigger is useful for creating the application for Spreadsheet.</description>

onSelectionChange has been released at April 22, 2020. But this couldn&#39;t be used at the released day. But now, I could confirm that this got to be able to be used. So in order to test this event trigger, I prepared a simple sample script. This is a sample script for detecting the change tab on Google Spreadsheet using onSelectionChange Event Trigger with Google Apps Script.
Demo Usage  Please copy and paste the following script to the container-bound script of Google Spreadsheet, and save the script.</description>
