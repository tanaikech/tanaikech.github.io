This is a sample script for simply editing the texts of texts boxes on Google Slides using Google Apps Script. The supposed situation is as follows.
 Google Slides has several text boxes of the same size and the same position. You want to retrieve the list of texts from the text boxes and want to change the texts using a simpler method.

This is a sample script for cropping images in the Google Slides using Google Apps Script. In the current stage, in order to crop the images in Google Slides, it is required to use replace(blobSource, crop) Because, although there is the &amp;ldquo;cropProperties&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;UpdateImagePropertiesRequest&amp;rdquo; in Slides API, unfortunately, in the current stage, this cannot be still used. This has already been reported. Ref
About cropping using replace(blobSource, crop), I thought that how to use might be a bit difficult.</description>

      <description>Gists
In this sample script, all pages in the Figma file are retrieved and the retrieved pages are put to new Google Slides as the image.
Usage 1. Retrieve access token You can see the method for retrieving the access token at here. Although there is also OAuth2 for retrieving the access token, in your situation, I thought that the method for directly generating the access token on the site might be suitable.</description>

When an image is inserted to Google Docs (Spreadsheet, Document and Slides) using the method of insertImage using Google Apps Script, there is the case that the error occurs. The error messages are &amp;ldquo;server error&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;invalid image data&amp;rdquo;. Here, I would like to introduce the limitations for inserting images to Google Docs. As the result, it was found that the limitation is due to both the mimeTypes and the area of image rather than the file size.</description>

This is a sample script for summarizing Slides as thumbnails. For example, it supposes a Slides including 15 pages. When this script is run, it summarizes 6 pages to one page as images. I created this because there are no methods for directly achieving this. This is useful for myself. If this is also useful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
The flow of this workaround is as follows.
Flow:  Copy the original Slides file as a temporary file.</description>

      <description>Gists
This is a document for explaining the difference between given values and retrieved values for shapes on Google Slides. When a shape is created to a slide using Slides API, most users give the size of height and width as pt. When the size is retrieved from the created shape as pt, the size is often difference from the given size.
For example, when a square shape is created by giving the height and width of 100 pt, the size which is retrieved from the created square becomes 99.</description>

This sample script is for retrieving the size (width and height) of a table in Google Slides using Google Apps Script.
There are no methods for directly retrieving the table size using SlidesApp yet. So I thought of a workaround using Slides API.
 When the slide information is retrieved using Slides.Presentations.Pages.get() of Slides API, the information of tables is also included. In the information, the height and width of table are also included.</description>
