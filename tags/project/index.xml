      <description>Overview This is a GAS project library for Google Apps Script (GAS).

Description There are Class SpreadsheetApp and Class DocumentApp for operating spreadsheet and document, respectively. But there is no Class for operating GAS project. If there is the Class ProjectApp, GAS project can be directly operated by GAS script. I thought that this will lead to new applications, and created ProjectApp.
On the other hand, as a CLI tool for operating GAS project, there has already been ggsrun.</description>
