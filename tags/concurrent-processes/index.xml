      <description>BatchRequest was updated to v1.2.1.   v1.2.1 (March 8, 2023)
 An option of exportDataAsBlob was added to the request object to the method of EDo(). Ref When this option is used, the response values from the batch requests are returned as Blob. By this, for example, when you export Google Spreadsheet as PDF data using the batch requests, the PDF data can be retrieved as Blob.    Sample script using exportDataAsBlob In this sample, the Spreadsheet and Document files are exported as PDF format using the batch requests.</description>

      <description>BatchRequest was updated to v1.2.0.   v1.2.0 (September 30, 2022)
 A new method of getBatchPath(name, version) was added. After August 12, 2020, in order to use batch requests, the batch path is required to be used to the endpoint of the batch requests. And, the batch path is sometimes updated. So, when a constant batch path has been continued to be used, this might lead to the reason for an error.</description>

Introduction When the users try to write to a Spreadsheet using a form, the developers have to consider the concurrent submission from the form. For example, when multiple users submit the data with the form simultaneously, all data are possibly not to be saved to the Spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a library for running Batch Requests using Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description When users use Google&amp;rsquo;s APIs, one quota is used for one API call. When the batch request is used, several APIs can be called by one quota, although there are some limitations in the batch request. For example, in GAS, Drive API can be used be DriveApp. In this case, the quota is not used for using Drive API.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a library for running the concurrent processing using only native Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description Have you ever thought about the concurrent processing using only native Google Apps Script (GAS)? So far, I had run the concurrent processing using golang, javascript and python. But the script cannot be used by the trigger event, because these are not native GAS. Recently, it was found that the fetchAll method added by the Google&amp;rsquo;s update at January 19, 2018 is worked by the asynchronous processing.</description>
