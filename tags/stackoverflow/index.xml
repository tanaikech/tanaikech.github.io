This is the statistics for the tag appscript on Stackoverflow. This statistics are retrieve from Stackoverflow using Stackexchange API. About 2020, the data is retrieved from 2020-01-01 to 2020-07-01.
Recently, this tag is modified by editing the tags. So I think that it has to be said that this statistics data is obtained at 2020-07-06.

      <description>This is a script for sending an email when users got comments at Stackoverflow. I had wished I could get an email when I got a comment at Stackoverflow. Although I investigated about this, it seems that I can get the email every 3 hours. For this situation, I wished I could get it much earlier. I thought that this can be achieved using GAS and Stack Exchange API. So I created this script.</description>
