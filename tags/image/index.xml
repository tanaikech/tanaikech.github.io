      <title>Retrieving Images on Spreadsheet</title>

      <description>Gist
This is a sample script for retrieving images on Spreadsheet.
Unfortunately, there are no methods for retrieving directly images on spreadsheet using GAS. So I use the method which retrieves URL from =image(URL) and retrieves the image from the URL.
In this case, =image(URL) has to be in the cell. Images embedded by insertImage() cannot be retrieved.
At first, please confirm them.
Sample script : var cell = &amp;quot;A1&amp;quot;; // Cell address with the function of &amp;quot;=image()&amp;quot; var filename = &amp;quot;samplename&amp;quot;; // Output filename var image = SpreadsheetApp.</description>

      <title>Updated: GAS Library - ImgApp</title>

      <description>ImgApp was updated to v1.1.0. New method was added.
2. doResize() Overview This method is for resizing images.
Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to resize images at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and resizes the image using setWidth() and setHeight(). But in this method, the resized blob cannot be retrieved. So although I had thought of other workaround, I had not been able to find it.</description>

      <description>1. getSize() Overview This method is for retrieving the width and height of image as the unit of pixel.
Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to directly retrieve the image size at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and retrieves the size using getWidth() and getHeight(). But in this method, it uses much time and resources on Google.</description>

      <title>GAS Library - CreateImg</title>

      <description>Recently, I had been looking for creating an image from coordinate data. Unfortunately I have never found them. So I made this. This Google Apps Script (GAS) library creates an image file from coordinate data.
You can see the detail information at https://github.com/tanaikech/CreateImg.
There is a part where I would like to improve in this library. That&amp;rsquo;s convByteSlice(). I think that there is the method to be faster about the part.</description>
