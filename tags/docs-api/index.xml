This is a report for inserting the multiple paragraphs to Google Document in order using Google Docs API.
When the multiple paragraphs are inserted to Google Document using Google Docs API, it is required to pay attention to the index for inserting the texts. In this report, I would like to introduce the points for achieving this with a simple method.
Although this report uses Google Apps Script, the logic of this method can be used for other language.</description>

These are sample scripts for modifying the 1st-page header in Google Document using Google Apps Script. Unfortunately, in the current stage, the 1st-page header cannot be modified by Document service. In this case, it is required to use Google Docs API. Here, I would like to introduce 2 sample scripts for modifying the 1st page header using Docs API.
When you use this, please enable Google Docs API at Advanced Google services.</description>

Unfortunately, in the current stage, although I had been looking for the method for creating a table and putting the values in each cell at the official document, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find. Google Docs API is growing now. So such documents might be not prepared yet. By this situation, I investigated about the method for achieving this method.</description>
