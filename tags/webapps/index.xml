Here, I would like to introduce a report for understanding the flow of the request to Web Apps created by Google Apps Script. There might be a case that various applications using the Web Apps are created and the Web Apps are used as the webhook. In that case, it is considered that when you have understood the flow of requests to the Web Apps, your goal might be able to be smoothly achieved.</description>

This report is a workaround for reflecting the latest Google Apps Script to the deployed Web Apps without redeploying.
Pattern 1 Of course, when the developer mode of https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/dev is used, the latest script can be used without redeploying.
But, in this case, only the permitted users can use it using the access token. when you want to achieve this using the endpoint of https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec without the access token, in order to reflect the latest script to Web Apps, it is required to redeploy.</description>

Abstract In Google Apps Script, there is the Web Apps. When Web Apps is used, the users can execute Google Apps Script using HTML and Javascript. This can be applied to various applications. When the Web Apps is deployed with &amp;ldquo;Anyone&amp;rdquo;, anyone can access the Web Apps. And, there is the case that Web Apps deployed with &amp;ldquo;Anyone&amp;rdquo; is required to be used. Under this condition, when 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) can be implemented, it is considered that the security can be higher and it leads to giving various directions for the applications using Web Apps.</description>

      <description>There is a method of ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() for obtaining the Web Apps URL in Google Apps Script.
  Before the V8 runtime is released, this method had returned the endpoint like https://script.google.com/macros/s/{deploymentId}/exec.
  After the V8 runtime was released, the endpoint of https://script.google.com/macros/s/{deploymentId}/dev was returned.
  Now, it seems that this returns https://script.google.com/macros/s/###/exec.
  But, in the current stage, when I access this endpoint, the message of Sorry, unable to open the file at this time.</description>
