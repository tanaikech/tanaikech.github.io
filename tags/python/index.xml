      <description>Overview This is a python library to manage the tables on Google Document using Google Docs API.
Description Google Docs API has been released. When I used this API, I found that it is very difficult for me to manage the tables on Google Document using Google Docs API. Although I checked the official document, unfortunately, I thought that it&#39;s very difficult for me. So in order to easily manage the tables on Google Document, I created this library.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a python library to retrieve the file list with the folder tree from the specific folder of Google Drive.
Description When I create applications for using Google Drive, I often retrieve a file list from a folder in the application. So far, I had created the script for retrieving a file list from a folder for each application. Recently, I thought that if there is the script for retrieving the file list with the folder tree from the folder of Google Drive as a library, it will be useful for me and other users.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;souwapy&amp;rdquo; is a library for summing array elements with high speed by new algorithm (Pyramid method). The speed is faster than csv and panbdas module of python and v8 engine of node.js. The souwapy module is 2.3 and 3.1 times faster than csv and pandas module, respectively. This was really surprised me. It was found that the theory was correct.
At first, I have created this theory for Google Apps Script.</description>

      <description>Suddenly I had to need this.
This script can get the duplicate number of each element in array at Python. In this script, the duplicate number of each element is obtained and sorted by the duplicate number. This was expressed by the comprehension.
data = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;] result = sorted({i: data.count(i) for i in set(data)}.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) print(result) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [(&#39;b&#39;, 4), (&#39;c&#39;, 3), (&#39;d&#39;, 2), (&#39;a&#39;, 1)] </description>

      <description>Abstract I have already reported that the pyramid method is one of very effectively algolithms for summing string elements in an array using Google Apps Script (GAS). This report describes the adaptability of the pyramid method to any languages except for GAS. c++ (g++), Go, Java, Javascript on Node.js, Python and Ruby were chosen as the sample languages. In those languages, there are languages which have the distinctive commands for summing the array elements.</description>
