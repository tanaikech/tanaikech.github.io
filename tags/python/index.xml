      <description>Overview This is a plugin of Sublime Text 3 for submitting files to both Gist and Slack.
Description I like to use Sublime Text for developing scripts. And when I discuss about developing scripts, I often use Slack. When I submitted a script to Slack, I had saved the script to Gist as a backup. I had done manually this on my browser. Namely, I wanted to be saving the revision of script while I&amp;rsquo;m discussing about the script at Slack.</description>

      <description>This sample is for error handling for subprocess.Popen. It confirms whether the execution file is existing. If the execution file is also not in the path, the error message is shown.
import subprocess res = subprocess.Popen( &amp;quot;application&amp;quot;, # &amp;lt;- Execution file stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True ).communicate() if len(res[1]) == 0: print(&amp;quot;ok: Application is existing.&amp;quot;) else: print(&amp;quot;Error: Application is not found.&amp;quot;)  </description>

      <title>Python Library - souwapy</title>
      <link>https://tanaikech.github.io/2016/10/30/python-library---souwapy/</link>

      <guid>https://tanaikech.github.io/2016/10/30/python-library---souwapy/</guid>
      <description>This &amp;ldquo;souwapy&amp;rdquo; is a library for summing array elements with high speed by new algorithm (Pyramid method). The speed is faster than csv and panbdas module of python and v8 engine of node.js. The souwapy module is 2.3 and 3.1 times faster than csv and pandas module, respectively. This was really surprised me. It was found that the theory was correct.
At first, I have created this theory for Google Apps Script.</description>

      <title>Element&#39;s Duplicate Number in Array at Python</title>
      <link>https://tanaikech.github.io/2016/10/21/elements-duplicate-number-in-array-at-python/</link>

      <description>Suddenly I had to need this.
This script can get the duplicate number of each element in array at Python. In this script, the duplicate number of each element is obtained and sorted by the duplicate number. This was expressed by the comprehension.
data = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;b&#39;] result = sorted({i: data.count(i) for i in set(data)}.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) print(result) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [(&#39;b&#39;, 4), (&#39;c&#39;, 3), (&#39;d&#39;, 2), (&#39;a&#39;, 1)]  </description>

      <description>Kanshi TANAIKE 
Abstract I have already reported that the pyramid method is one of very effectively algolithms for summing string elements in an array using Google Apps Script (GAS). This report describes the adaptability of the pyramid method to any languages except for GAS. c++ (g++), Go, Java, Javascript on Node.js, Python and Ruby were chosen as the sample languages. In those languages, there are languages which have the distinctive commands for summing the array elements.</description>
