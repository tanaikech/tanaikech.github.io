When I create applications for using Google Drive, I often retrieve a file list from a folder in the application. So far, I had created the script for retrieving a file list from a folder for each application. Recently, I thought that if there is the script for retrieving the file list with the folder tree from the folder of Google Drive as a library, it will be useful for me and other users.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving a folder tree using Node.js. In this sample, you can set the top of folder for the folder tree. In generally, the folder tree is created by retrieving folders from the top folder in order. For example, when Google Apps Script is used, the script becomes like this. But when Drive API is used for this situation, if there are a lot of folders in the top folder, a lot of APIs are required to be called.</description>
