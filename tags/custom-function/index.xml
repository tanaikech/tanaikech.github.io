      <description>Overview This is a proposal of the enhanced custom function for Google Spreadsheet using Web Apps as the wrapper.
Demo Description When the custom function is used, in the current specification, the most methods except several methods (for example, one of them is UrlFetchApp.) that the authorization is required cannot be used. So for example, when the filenames in the folder are retrieved from the folder name, unfortunately, this cannot be directly achieved.</description>

Description I have already reported about &amp;ldquo;Automatic Recalculation of Custom Function on Spreadsheet Part 1&amp;rdquo; at here. Here, I would like to introduce other workaround for forcibly recalculating the custom functions and built-in functions using Class TextFinder. Class TextFinder has added at April 5, 2019. By this, this workaround can be proposed.
Sample scripts Pattern 1 If you want to refresh all functions of all sheets in a Spreadsheet, you can use the following script.</description>

This is a sample script for fixing a value putting by a custom function of Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. When a custom function is used, the value retrieved by the custom function of Spreadsheet is automatically updated by recalculating. So in the case that the value retrieved by the custom function is changed by the time, the value is also changed by automatically updating. In this sample script, I would like to introduce a method for fixing such values.</description>

In this report, I would like to introduce a workaround for automatically recalculating custom functions on Spreadsheet.
1. Situation The sample situation is below. This is a sample situation for this document.
 There are 3 sheets with &amp;ldquo;sheet1&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;sheet2&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sheet3&amp;rdquo; of sheet name in a Spreadsheet. Calculate the summation of values of &amp;ldquo;A1&amp;rdquo; of each sheet using a custom function. Sample script of the custom function is as follows.</description>
