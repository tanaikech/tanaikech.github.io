Overview This script checks if the desired API is enabled or disabled in the Advanced Google Services section of Google Apps Script.
Introduction As of December 11, 2023, Drive API v3 became available for use in Advanced Google Services. Ref This means you can now choose between v2 and v3 in your scripts. However, when Drive API is enabled, version 3 is automatically selected. This caused compatibility issues with previously published libraries that relied on v2.</description>

Abstract Google offers powerful APIs but using them (except advanced services) can be complex. A new, simpler method would benefit developers creating diverse applications. To address this, I built a Google Apps Script library simplifying API access.
Description There are numerous powerful Google APIs available today. Google Apps Script streamlines interacting with these APIs through a simplified authorization process. Additionally, advanced Google services integrate seamlessly with Apps Script, making Google APIs highly advantageous for users.</description>

Introduction This is a report for taking advantage of the auto-completion of the script editor for Google Apps Script.
In the current stage, the auto-completion is implemented in the script editor of Google Apps Script. This auto-completion can be used for not only the built-in classes and methods but also the methods for Javascript. This helps develop scripts and applications very much. In the case of the built-in classes and methods and the methods for Javascript, you can see the detailed specifications of the documents like the official documents and developer.</description>

      <description>Gists
When Google APIs are used with googleapis for Python, the client is obtained as follows.
creds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(service_account_credential_file, scopes=scopes) service = build(&amp;#34;drive&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;v3&amp;#34;, credentials=creds) In this case, when the script is run, the access token is retrieved every time. But, the expiration time of the retrieved access token is 1 hour. Here, there might be the case that you want to use the access token until the expiration time. It is considered that effectively using the access token will lead to SDGs.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving the access token from the service account using oauth2client and google-auth with Python.
Sample script 1 Use oauth2client.
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials  SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = &amp;#34;credentials.json&amp;#34; SCOPES = [&amp;#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&amp;#34;]  creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES) res = creds.get_access_token() access_token = res.access_token  print(access_token) Sample script 2 Use google-auth. In the current stage, this method might be general.
from google.oauth2 import service_account import google.auth.transport.requests  SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = &amp;#34;credentials.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a Node.js module to run the batch requests of Google APIs.
Description In Google APIs, there are APIs where batch requests can be run. The batch requests can run multiple API calls by one API call with the asynchronous process. By this, both the process cost and the quota cost can be reduced. Ref In Node.js, the wonderful module of googleapis for Node.js is existing. But, in the current stage, unfortunately, it seems that the googleapis for Node.</description>
