This is a sample script of Node.js for downloading the data and uploading the data to Google Drive with the resumable upload without saving it as a file. The downloaded data is uploaded to Google Drive with the stream.
Sample script Before you use this, please set the variables of accessToken, url, fileSize, mimeType and filename. In this case, fileSize is required to set because the data is uploaded with the resumable upload.</description>
