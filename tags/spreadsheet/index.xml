In the current stage, UrlFetchApp of Google Apps Script cannot be retrieved the data from Content-Type of &amp;lsquo;text/event-stream&amp;rsquo;. This sample script can be used for achieving this as a workaround.
This sample script uses EventSource. So this script uses a dialog on Google Docs files (This sample uses Google Spreadsheet.).</description>

This is a workaround for converting the range ID to the range object on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script.
When the named range is put to a cell as the hyperlink as follows,
the hyperlink is like #rangeid=123456789. When this link is clicked, it moves to the cells of the named range. So it is considered that this value of #rangeid=123456789 includes the information about the range of the named range.</description>

Abstract This is a report for detecting quickly checked checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. It supposes that when the checkbox is checked, a function of Google Apps Script is run by the event trigger. In this case, when the multiple checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet are checked quickly, the script cannot be run for all checked checkboxes, because of the response speed of the event trigger. It is considered that to understand the response of event trigger is useful for creating the application for Spreadsheet.</description>

Abstract I have already reported about &amp;ldquo;Change Tab Detection on Google Spreadsheet using onSelectionChange Event Trigger with Google Apps Script&amp;rdquo;. Ref It is considered that when the situation which uses the event trigger of onSelectionChange is thought, the response speed is important. So, here, I investigated the characteristics of response for the event trigger of onSelectionChange.
Demo Experiment Sample script In order to investigate the response speed, I used the following sample script.</description>

onSelectionChange has been released at April 22, 2020. But this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be used at the released day. But now, I could confirm that this got to be able to be used. So in order to test this event trigger, I prepared a simple sample script. This is a sample script for detecting the change tab on Google Spreadsheet using onSelectionChange Event Trigger with Google Apps Script.
Demo Usage  Please copy and paste the following script to the container-bound script of Google Spreadsheet, and save the script.</description>

      <description>Gists
Recently, it seems that the specification of Google Spreadsheet was updated. Before this, when a cell has only one hyperlink. In this case, the hyperlink was given to a cell using =HYPERLINK(&amp;quot;http://www.google.com/&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Google&amp;quot;) as following figure.
But by the recent update, a cell got to be able to have multiple hyperlinks as following figure. In this case, the hyperlinks are set by the RichTextValue object.
In this report, I would like to introduce the method for setting and retrieving the multiple URLs for a cell.</description>

Introduction Please be careful! This result can be only used for Google Apps Script.
There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes for Consumer and Google Apps free edition, and 30 minutes for G Suite and Early Access. 1 So many users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of scripts. So it is very important to know the process cost of various situations.</description>

The error messages are &amp;ldquo;server error&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;invalid image data&amp;rdquo;. Here, I would like to introduce the limitations for inserting images to Google Docs. As the result, it was found that the limitation is due to both the mimeTypes and the area of image rather than the file size.</description>

When a chart is created by using EmbeddedChartBuilder of Spreadsheet service, the title of vAxis which is put by setOption(&amp;quot;vAxis&amp;quot;, {title: &amp;quot;y axis&amp;quot;}) doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. It is considered that this is a bug. Because I have confirmed that this had worked fine. Ref But this specification had been changed. So I would like to introduce the method for adding the title of vAxis when a chart is created using Google Apps Script.</description>

This is a sample script for expanding a1Notations using Google Apps Script (GAS). In this script, for example, &amp;ldquo;A1:E3&amp;rdquo; is expanded to &amp;ldquo;A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, A3, B3, C3, D3, E3&amp;rdquo;. When each cell in &amp;ldquo;A1:E3&amp;rdquo; is checked, this script might be able to be used. If this was useful for your situation, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
Script: function expandA1Notation(a1Notations) { var columnToLetter = function(column) { var temp, letter = &amp;#39;&amp;#39;; while (column &amp;gt; 0) { temp = (column - 1) % 26; letter = String.</description>

Description There is Class RangeList as one of classes for Spreadsheet. There is setValue(value) in Class RangeList as a method. setValue(value) puts value to the cells of range list. Recently, when I used this method, I noticed that the following situations what I want cannot be achieved.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving the last coordinate of the specific row and column. When the methods of getLastRow() and getLastColumn() of Class Range for Spreadsheet are used, the last coordinates of the vertical and horizontal data range can be retrieved. When users want to retrieve the last coordinates of each row and column, there are no methods. So I created this script. I think that there are several scripts for this situation.</description>

      <description>Gists
Introduction Here I would like to introduce about the limitation of images for inserting to Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script (GAS). When you want to insert the images to Spreadsheet using GAS, insertImage() of class Sheet is usually used for this situation. At this time, an error sometimes occurs. This indicates that there is the limitation for inserting images to Spreadsheet. So I investigated the limitation.
As a result, it was found that the limitation depends on the image area (pixels^2) rather than the file size of it.</description>

In the case appending values to cell by inserting rows, when sheets.spreadsheets.values.append is used, the values are appended to the next empty row of the last row. If you want to append values to between cells with values by inserting row, you can achieve it using sheets.spreadsheets.batchUpdate.
When you use this, please use your access token.

This sample script is for measuring the execution time of built-in functions for Google Spreadsheet. Unfortunately, there are not measurement tools for retrieving the execution time of built-in functions. So I thought of about a workaround.
Flow :  Import a value to a cell. The value is anything good, because this is used as a trigger. Please do this by yourself.  Custom functions cannot use setValue(). So I used onEdit().</description>

This sample script is for straightening elements in 2 dimensional array using Google Apps Script (GAS). When applications using Spreadsheet are developed by GAS, it usually uses 2 dimensional array by setValues(). And the lengths of each element are required to be the same. On the other hand, data used for the applications might not be the same length for each element in 2 dimensional array. This sample script can be used under such situation.</description>

      <description>This sample script embeds a chart to a cell using custom function on Spreadsheet.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When you want to create a chart and embed it to a cell using custom functions, you notice that insertChart() cannot be used. There are some limitations for using custom functions. But insertChart() creates floating charts. So in order to embed a chart to a cell, the function =IMAGE() is suitable for this situation.</description>

      <description>This sample script sends an e-mail, when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4. When you use this sample, please create a container bound script with spreadsheet which is edited by Sheet API. And please input your e-mail and run firstly a method of createTrigger(). By this, a trigger is installed as onChange(). After this, edit spreadsheet from outside by Sheet API v4.
When when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4, I used sendEmail() as a sample, because script editor is closed.</description>

      <description>This sample script retrieves the user information which is editing the shared spreadsheet.
It was found as follows.
 User information retrieving by Class Session is the owner and users which installed triggers by themselves. When each user installs a trigger, user information retrieving by Class Session losts the accuracy. So user information has to be retrieved using a temporally installed trigger. Using onOpen(), it cannot directly install triggers and authorize.</description>

      <description>About Event Objects For example, it thinks the situation of input text of &amp;lsquo;test&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;A1&amp;rsquo; on a sheet.
When you use only &amp;lsquo;onEdit(e)&amp;rsquo; without an installing trigger, &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; has following parameters.
{authMode=LIMITED, range=Range, source=Spreadsheet, user=, value=test}  In this case, the event cannot send an e-mail because of &amp;lsquo;authMode=LIMITED&amp;rsquo;.
When you use &amp;ldquo;onEdit(e)&amp;rdquo; with an installing trigger of &amp;ldquo;Edit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo; has following parameters.
{authMode=FULL, range=Range, source=Spreadsheet, value=test, triggerUid=#####}  In this case, the event can send an e-mail because of &amp;lsquo;authMode=FULL&amp;rsquo;.</description>
