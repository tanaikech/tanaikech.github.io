      <description>BatchRequest was updated to v1.2.0.   v1.2.0 (September 30, 2022)
 A new method of getBatchPath(name, version) was added. After August 12, 2020, in order to use batch requests, the batch path is required to be used to the endpoint of the batch requests. And, the batch path is sometimes updated. So, when a constant batch path has been continued to be used, this might lead to the reason for an error.</description>

By using this, for example, users can modify filenames of a lot of files on Google Drive. But there are limitations for the number of API calls which can process in one batch request.
