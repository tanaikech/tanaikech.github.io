Introduction By recent Google update (Google update at October 24, 2017), various new winds to GAS developers were blown. There is &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; as one of the new winds. &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; makes us manage the project using JSON. Especially, the special scopes which have to use OAuth2 process can be used by only setting them to the Manifests. I think that this is the largest modification. However, when scopes are added to a project using Manifests, users who use the project can use only added scopes.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a Manifests library for Google Apps Scripts.
Description By recent update of Google, Manifests was added to Google Apps Script Project. At the moment I saw the detail, I thought that this Manifests will blow a new wind for a lot of GAS developers. So I created this.
This library makes users easily access Manifests using Google Apps Script. If this was useful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.</description>
