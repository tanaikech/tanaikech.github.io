This sample script is for retrieving files with filename included special characters using Google Apps Script. The files are used on Google Drive.
The files with filename of special characters cannot be retrieved using DriveApp.getFilesByName(). This workaround solved this.
As a query parameter, name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is used. This contains is very important. name=&#39;filename with special characters&#39; cannot retrieve such files. Today, it was found that name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is the workaround.</description>
