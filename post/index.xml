This is a sample script for replacing the multiple paragraphs on Google Document with a regex using Google Apps Script. There is the method of replaceText(searchPattern, replacement) for replacing the text on Google Document. Ref For example, when a text of sample1 is replaced with sample2, this can be achieved by a script like DocumentApp.getActiveDocument().getBody().replaceText(&amp;quot;sample1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sample2&amp;quot;). But, when the texts for replacing are the multiple paragraphs, this script cannot be used.</description>

But when we want to use the custom form, it is required to use the HTML form on Web Apps, dialog, and sidebar. In this case, it is required to prepare Javascript and Google Apps Script for parsing the form object from the HTML form and appending the parsed values to Spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>On January 19, 2022, 2 classes of CellImageBuilder and CellImage have been added to the Spreadsheet Service.
 CellImageBuilder: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/cell-image-builder CellImage: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/cell-image  Unfortunately, in the current stage, it seems that the image manually put to a cell without using the URL cannot still be retrieved.
 When an image is manually put from URL and Google Drive to a cell, this image cannot be retrieved. When an image is put using setSourceUrl method with a script, this image and URL cannot be retrieved.</description>

From Apps Script Pulse by Martin Hawksey, it was found that the invalid blob of sending the file of HTML form to Google Apps Script side using google.script.run has finally been resolved. In this case, this script can be used with V8 runtime.</description>

When the named range is put to a cell as the hyperlink as follows,
the hyperlink is like #rangeid=123456789. When this link is clicked, it moves to the cells of the named range. So it is considered that this value of #rangeid=123456789 includes the information about the range of the named range.</description>

This is a sample script for simply editing the texts of texts boxes on Google Slides using Google Apps Script. The supposed situation is as follows.
 Google Slides has several text boxes of the same size and the same position. You want to retrieve the list of texts from the text boxes and want to change the texts using a simpler method.  In this case, I thought that when the sidebar created by Google Apps Script is used for changing the texts, your goal might be able to be simply achieved.</description>

This is a sample script for sorting the cells on Google Spreadsheet with the background colors using Google Apps Script.
Unfortunately, in the current stage, it seems that sort(sortSpecObj) of Class Range cannot directly sort by the background colors of cells. But when Sheets API is used, this goal can be achieved. Here, &amp;ldquo;SortRangeRequest&amp;rdquo; of the method of &amp;ldquo;spreadsheets.batchUpdate&amp;rdquo; in Sheets API is used.

I have already reported for showing the log to &amp;ldquo;Apps Script Dashboard&amp;rdquo; when it requests to the Web Apps. Ref In order to show the log to &amp;ldquo;Apps Script Dashboard&amp;rdquo; when it requests to the Web Apps, it is required to use the access token. But in the current stage, when the access token is used for XMLHttpRequest and fetch of Javascript in the request headers, the error related to CORS occurs.</description>

These are the sample scripts for achieving the switching buttons for Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. The management of images using Spreadsheet service is growing now. But, in the current stage, in order to achieve the switching buttons, it needs a little ingenuity. In this report, I would like to introduce 4 kinds of the switching buttons.
Pattern 1 In this pattern, the drawing is used as the button.</description>

This is a sample script for directly using the request body of the string JSON for Google APIs with googleapis of golang.
At googleapis for golang, when Google API is used, it is required to create the request body like this sample script. I have several contacts for creating about such request body. I thought that such script might be a bit difficult for users. I thought that when the string JSON object is directly used for this, it might be useful.</description>

      <description>I noticed that the specification of Files: copy in Drive API was changed. About the method of Files: copy in Drive API v3, this method could be used with the scope of https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly until July 5, 2020. But I confirmed that in the current stage, the scope is required to be changed to the following scopes.
 https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.photos.readonly  Please be careful this.</description>

Abstract This is a report for detecting quickly checked checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script. It supposes that when the checkbox is checked, a function of Google Apps Script is run by the event trigger. In this case, when the multiple checkboxes on Google Spreadsheet are checked quickly, the script cannot be run for all checked checkboxes, because of the response speed of the event trigger. It is considered that to understand the response of event trigger is useful for creating the application for Spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>Overview This is Google Apps Script library for copying folder on Google Drive.
Description I have sometimes the situation that it is required to back up the folder on Google Drive to Google Drive. But unfortunately, the method of makeCopy() of Class File and the method of Files: copy of Drive API cannot be used for directly copying the folder on Google Drive. So I created this as a library. This library can copy the folder on Google Drive.</description>

But by the recent update, a cell got to be able to have multiple hyperlinks as following figure. In this case, the hyperlinks are set by the RichTextValue object.
In this report, I would like to introduce the method for setting and retrieving the multiple URLs for a cell.</description>

Their discussions bring the important information and are much useful for a lot of people. As one of tags, there is &amp;ldquo;google-apps-script&amp;rdquo;. I sometimes discuss at the questions with that tag. When we see the discussions, we can notice that the discussions are changed and progressed by the time, because &amp;ldquo;Google Apps Script&amp;rdquo; which is the origin of the tag is updated.</description>

      <description>Gists
This is a sample script for retrieving the event ID from the event URL of Google Calendar using Google Apps Script.
The event URL is like https://www.google.com/calendar/event?###. At the event URL, ### of https://www.google.com/calendar/event?### is not the event ID. So it is required to convert it.
Sample script var eventUrl = &amp;#34;https://www.google.com/calendar/event?###&amp;#34;; var eventId = Utilities.newBlob(Utilities.base64Decode(eventUrl.split(&amp;#34;=&amp;#34;)[1]))  .getDataAsString()  .split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;)[0]; Logger.log(eventId); </description>

This is a sample script for modifying the revisions of a file on Google Drive using Google Apps Script. This script can be used for not only Google Docs files, but also the files except for Google Docs.
Issue and workaround: Unfortunately, in the current stage, at Google Docs files, the revision of Google Docs cannot be directly changed by APIs with a script. So as one of several workarounds, I would like to propose to overwrite the Google Docs file using the exported data.</description>

Introduction Please be careful! This result can be only used for Google Apps Script.
There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes for Consumer and Google Apps free edition, and 30 minutes for G Suite and Early Access. 1 So many users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of scripts. So it is very important to know the process cost of various situations.</description>

This is a sample script for &amp;ldquo;Examples of How to Derive a Signing Key for Signature Version 4&amp;rdquo; using Google Apps Script.
In order to use AWS SDKs, there are the sample scripts for the languages of Java, .NET (C#), Python, Ruby, JavaScript (Node.js). But the sample script of Google Apps Script is not prepared. I saw the question related to this at Stackoverflow. So I would like to also introduce the sample script here.</description>

This is a sample script for parsing HTML using Google Apps Script. When HTML data is converted to Google Document, the HTML data can be parsed and be converted to Google Document. In this case, the paragraphs, lists and tables are included. From this situation, I thought that this situation can be used for parsing HTML using Google Apps Script. So I could came up with this method.
In the Sheet API, the HTML data can be put to the Spreadsheet with the PasteDataRequest.</description>

This is a sample script for sorting a slice using Golang. Recently, I had a situation for sorting the coordinates of cells of Spreadsheet. As a test case, it thinks of the situation that the randomized cells are sorted. I think that this can be also used for a table except for Spreadsheet.
Sample slice: The sample slice is as follows.
ar := []struct {row intcol intvalue string}{{0, 0, &amp;#34;A1&amp;#34;},{0, 1, &amp;#34;B1&amp;#34;},{0, 2, &amp;#34;C1&amp;#34;},{1, 0, &amp;#34;A2&amp;#34;},{1, 1, &amp;#34;B2&amp;#34;},{1, 3, &amp;#34;D2&amp;#34;},{2, 0, &amp;#34;A3&amp;#34;},{2, 2, &amp;#34;C3&amp;#34;},} When each element of above slice is put to a Spreadsheet, it becomes as follows.</description>

This sample script is for using the string values to []googleapi.Field for Golang. The property of fields can often be used to the Google APIs. When such APIs are used by the Go library, there are the cases that fields parameter is required to be used. For example, at the quickstart of Drive API for golang, the value is directly put to Fields() like r, err := srv.Files.List().PageSize(10).Fields(&amp;quot;nextPageToken, files(id, name)&amp;quot;).</description>

      <description>Overview This is a Google Apps Script for notifying with email when Netatmo was down.
Description I&amp;rsquo;m measuring the surrounding environment using Netatmo. There were little that my Netatmo was down so far. But recently, my Netatmo is sometimes down. It is considered that the reason is due to the thermal runaway, because the recent Japan is very hot. When Netatmo was down, users can know it by logging in using the browser and/or running the mobile application.</description>

      <description>Gists
This is a sample script for retrieving the last coordinate of the specific row and column. When the methods of getLastRow() and getLastColumn() of Class Range for Spreadsheet are used, the last coordinates of the vertical and horizontal data range can be retrieved. When users want to retrieve the last coordinates of each row and column, there are no methods. So I created this script. I think that there are several scripts for this situation.</description>

      <description>This is a script for sending an email when users got comments at Stackoverflow. I had wished I could get an email when I got a comment at Stackoverflow. Although I investigated about this, it seems that I can get the email every 3 hours. For this situation, I wished I could get it much earlier. I thought that this can be achieved using GAS and Stack Exchange API. So I created this script.</description>

This is for adding the query parameters to the URL. This sample script is prepared by ES5. So this can be also used for Javascript. When I created an endpoint with some query parameters, I had used the scripts of various patterns every time. Today, I prepared this sample script to unify them. If this is also useful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
Sample script : String.prototype.addQuery = function(obj) {  return this + Object.</description>

      <description>Gists
Introduction Here I would like to introduce about the limitation of images for inserting to Spreadsheet using Google Apps Script (GAS). When you want to insert the images to Spreadsheet using GAS, insertImage() of class Sheet is usually used for this situation. At this time, an error sometimes occurs. This indicates that there is the limitation for inserting images to Spreadsheet. So I investigated the limitation.
As a result, it was found that the limitation depends on the image area (pixels^2) rather than the file size of it.</description>

There are no prepared methods for retrieving the number of lines in the Google Document. So I thought this workaround. If the end of each line can be detected, the number of lines can be retrieved. So I tried to add the end markers of each line using OCR.
At Google Documents, when a sentence is over the page width, the sentence automatically has the line break. But the line break has no \r\n or \n.</description>

This sample script retrieves the difference elements between 2 dimensional arrays using Google Apps Script. In Google Apps Script, 2 dimensional arrays are often used at Google Docs and Google APIs. And from my recent report, it has already found that the process cost of filter() is the lowest in the other loop methods. So I use the script like this.
var ar1 = [[&amp;#34;a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c1&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c2&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b3&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c3&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a4&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b4&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c4&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c5&amp;#34;]]; var ar2 = [[&amp;#34;a2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c2&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b5&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c5&amp;#34;], [&amp;#34;a1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;b2&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c3&amp;#34;]];  var res = ar1.</description>

The sample output is {&amp;quot;name1&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Sheet1!A1:B2&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;name2&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Sheet2!B1:C2&amp;quot;,,,}. The name of named range has to be only one in the spreadsheet. This was used.
Sheets.Spreadsheets.get() of Sheets API can retrieve all named ranges.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a library for running the concurrent processing using only native Google Apps Script (GAS).
Description Have you ever thought about the concurrent processing using only native Google Apps Script (GAS)? So far, I had run the concurrent processing using golang, javascript and python. But the script cannot be used by the trigger event, because these are not native GAS. Recently, it was found that the fetchAll method added by the Google&amp;rsquo;s update at January 19, 2018 is worked by the asynchronous processing.</description>

By Google&amp;rsquo;s update at January 19, 2018, fetchAll method was added to the UrlFetch service. When I saw the usage, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the detail information about the actual running state. So I investigated about it.
As the result, it was found that the fetchAll method is worked by the asynchronous processing. The returned data is reordered by the order of requests. By this, it was also found that if you want to retrieve the data from the several URL, the process cost of UrlFetchApp.</description>

Benchmark: Loop for Array Processing using Google Apps Script July 26, 2018 Updated. Result of reduce was added.
Kanshi Tanaike
Introduction Please be careful! This result can be only used for Google Apps Script.
There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). That is 6 minutes.1 So users always have to pay attention to reducing the process cost of the scripts. Especially, it is very important to know the process cost for the array processing, because the array processing is often used for spreadsheet and Google APIs.</description>

Introduction There are event objects at Google Apps Script. Typically, users which use Spreadsheet often use onEdit(event). Here, I would like to introduce the process costs for the event objects using this onEdit(event).
When onEdit(event) is used for the spreadsheet, event of onEdit(event) has the following structure.
{  &amp;#34;authMode&amp;#34;: {},  &amp;#34;range&amp;#34;: {  &amp;#34;columnStart&amp;#34;: 1,  &amp;#34;rowStart&amp;#34;: 1,  &amp;#34;rowEnd&amp;#34;: 1,  &amp;#34;columnEnd&amp;#34;: 1  },  &amp;#34;source&amp;#34;: {},  &amp;#34;oldValue&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;old sample text&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;user&amp;#34;: {  &amp;#34;nickname&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;sampleName&amp;#34;,  &amp;#34;email&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;sample email&amp;#34;  },  &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;sample text&amp;#34; } In this structure, for example, the range of active cell is &amp;quot;range&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;columnStart&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;rowStart&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;rowEnd&amp;quot;: 1, &amp;quot;columnEnd&amp;quot;: 1 }.</description>

In the case appending values to cell by inserting rows, when sheets.spreadsheets.values.append is used, the values are appended to the next empty row of the last row. If you want to append values to between cells with values by inserting row, you can achieve it using sheets.spreadsheets.batchUpdate.
When you use this, please use your access token.
Endpoint : POST https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/### spreadsheet ID ###:batchUpdate Request body : In this request body, it appends the data of &amp;ldquo;sample1, sample2, sample3&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;A1:A3&amp;rdquo; of the sheetId of &amp;ldquo;1234567890&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Description : This sample script is for retrieving emails which replied for received mails. Because there are no samples which confirm whether the owner (me) replied to the received mails, I created this. The point is as follows.
 When there are more than 2 messages in a thread, there might be a possibility to have replied. For more than 2 messages in a thread  The email address of &amp;ldquo;from&amp;rdquo; for the 1st message is the sender&amp;rsquo;s address.</description>

      <description>Overview This is a GAS project library for Google Apps Script (GAS). This library can be used for the projects of both standalone script type and container-bound script type.
Description There are Class SpreadsheetApp and Class DocumentApp for operating spreadsheet and document, respectively. But there is no Class for operating GAS project. If there is such Class ProjectApp, GAS project can be directly operated by GAS script. I thought that this will lead to new applications, and created ProjectApp.</description>

There is the bathing requests in the Google APIs. The bathing requests can use the several API calls as a single HTTP request. By using this, for example, users can modify filenames of a lot of files on Google Drive. But there are limitations for the number of API calls which can process in one batch request. For example, Drive API can be used the maximum of 100 calls in one batch request.</description>

      <description>RearrangeScripts was published as an add-on application Recently, I have reported RearrangeScripts for rearranging scripts in a GAS project. At that time, I got messages and mails from many developers. They said that you should publish this as an add-on. So, this was released. Now you can search &amp;ldquo;RearrangeScripts&amp;rdquo; as an add-on for Spreadsheet. If this is helpful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m happy.

This is a document for explaining the difference between given values and retrieved values for shapes on Google Slides. When a shape is created to a slide using Slides API, most users give the size of height and width as pt. When the size is retrieved from the created shape as pt, the size is often difference from the given size.
For example, when a square shape is created by giving the height and width of 100 pt, the size which is retrieved from the created square becomes 99.</description>

Introduction By recent Google update (Google update at October 24, 2017), various new winds to GAS developers were blown. There is &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; as one of the new winds. &amp;ldquo;Manifests&amp;rdquo; makes us manage the project using JSON. Especially, the special scopes which have to use OAuth2 process can be used by only setting them to the Manifests. I think that this is the largest modification. However, when scopes are added to a project using Manifests, users who use the project can use only added scopes.</description>

This sample script is for retrieving the size (width and height) of a table in Google Slides using Google Apps Script.
There are no methods for directly retrieving the table size using SlidesApp yet. So I thought of a workaround using Slides API.
 When the slide information is retrieved using Slides.Presentations.Pages.get() of Slides API, the information of tables is also included. In the information, the height and width of table are also included.</description>

This sample script is for measuring the execution time of built-in functions for Google Spreadsheet. Unfortunately, there are not measurement tools for retrieving the execution time of built-in functions. So I thought of about a workaround.
Flow :  Import a value to a cell. The value is anything good, because this is used as a trigger. Please do this by yourself.  Custom functions cannot use setValue(). So I used onEdit().</description>

This sample script is for straightening elements in 2 dimensional array using Google Apps Script (GAS). When applications using Spreadsheet are developed by GAS, it usually uses 2 dimensional array by setValues(). And the lengths of each element are required to be the same. On the other hand, data used for the applications might not be the same length for each element in 2 dimensional array. This sample script can be used under such situation.</description>

      <description>go-rearrange and gorearrange were updated to v.1.0.1  As one of outputs, indexmode (bool) was added. If this is true, the rearranged result is output as the change of index for the source data. For example, if the source data and rearranged data are [&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;] and [&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;], respectively. The output will become [2, 1, 0].  By this, the specification for creating applications will expand.

I think that the detail information of google-api-go-client is a bit little. The sample scripts are so little. It retrieves most information from only godoc and GitHub. So I publish such sample scripts here. If this is useful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
Important points :  Give mimeType of file that it wants to upload to options of Media(r io.</description>

So the time until timeout of fetch was modified from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.</description>

This sample script is for retrieving files with filename included special characters using Google Apps Script. The files are used on Google Drive.
The files with filename of special characters cannot be retrieved using DriveApp.getFilesByName(). This workaround solved this.
As a query parameter, name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is used. This contains is very important. name=&#39;filename with special characters&#39; cannot retrieve such files. Today, it was found that name contains &#39;filename with special characters&#39; is the workaround.</description>

When it uses Google Sheets API v4, GridRange is used for it as the range property. These sample scripts are for converting from a1Notation to GridRange. You can chose from following 2 scripts. Both scripts can retrieve the same result.
Script 1 : This is from me.
function a1notation2gridrange1(sheetid, a1notation) {  var data = a1notation.match(/(^.+)!(.+):(.+$)/);  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById(sheetid).getSheetByName(data[1]);  var range = ss.getRange(data[2] + &amp;#34;:&amp;#34; + data[3]);  var gridRange = {  sheetId: ss.</description>

Here, I introduce 2 scripts for uploading files to Slack using Node.js as samples. These 2 sample scripts are for uploading files to Slack.
Sample script 1:  You can upload the zip file by converting byte array as follows.  At first, it builds form-data. Adds the zip file converted to byte array and boundary using Buffer.concat(). This is used as body in request.    Basically, this is almost the same to the method using GAS.</description>

These sample scripts are for requesting multipart post using Google Apps Script.
In most cases, the multipart request is used for uploading files. So I prepared 2 sample situations as follows. For each situation, the request parameters are different.
 Upload a file from Google Drive to Slack. Convert an excel file to Spreadsheet on Google Drive using Drive API v3.  Multipart post is required for these situations.</description>

This is a sample script for retrieving images on Spreadsheet.
Unfortunately, there are no methods for retrieving directly images on spreadsheet using GAS. So I use the method which retrieves URL from =image(URL) and retrieves the image from the URL.
In this case, =image(URL) has to be in the cell. Images embedded by insertImage() cannot be retrieved.
At first, please confirm them.
Sample script : var cell = &amp;#34;A1&amp;#34;; // Cell address with the function of &amp;#34;=image()&amp;#34; var filename = &amp;#34;samplename&amp;#34;; // Output filename  var image = SpreadsheetApp.</description>

      <description>ggsrun was updated to v.1.2.2  For Google Docs (spreadsheet, document, slide and drawing), since I noticed that the revision files would not be able to be retrieved using Drive API v3, I modified this using new workaround.  The new workaround is to use Drive API v2. drive.revisions.get of Drive API v2 can retrieve not only the revision list, but also the export links. I thought of the use of the export links.</description>

2. doResize() Overview This method is for resizing images.
Description Unfortunately, there are no methods to resize images at Google Apps Script. As a workaround, there is a method that it imports the image in Google Document and resizes the image using setWidth() and setHeight(). But in this method, the resized blob cannot be retrieved. So although I had thought of other workaround, I had not been able to find it.</description>

      <description>This sample script is for searching route between place A and B and embedding a map by custom function on Spreadsheet.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When the map is embedded to a cell on spreadsheet as an image, the function =IMAGE() is suitable for this situation. However, Class Maps, setFormula() for importing =IMAGE() and DriveApp.createFile() for creating images from maps also cannot be used for custom functions.</description>

      <description>Description There are a limit executing time for Google Apps Script (GAS). It&amp;rsquo;s 6 minutes. So users have to pay attention to the process cost of the script. GAS can use JavaScript 1.7. This means to be able to be used comprehension for GAS.
In this report, the process cost for the comprehension has been investigated. The normal for loop was used as the competitor. As a result, it was found that the comprehension can be used one of methods for reducing the process cost.</description>

      <description>This sample script is for embedding animation GIF in a cell using custom function on Spreadsheet.
I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem There are some limitations.
 Images of jpeg and png can be embedded in a cell using =IMAGE(). But when animation GIF is embedded using it, GIF is not played. insertImage() can insert the animation GIF to sheet. But it is not imported to one cell.</description>

I think that this method is one of various ideas.
Problem When you want to create a chart and embed it to a cell using custom functions, you notice that insertChart() cannot be used. There are some limitations for using custom functions. But insertChart() creates floating charts. So in order to embed a chart to a cell, the function =IMAGE() is suitable for this situation.</description>

      <description>This sample script sends an e-mail, when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4. When you use this sample, please create a container bound script with spreadsheet which is edited by Sheet API. And please input your e-mail and run firstly a method of createTrigger(). By this, a trigger is installed as onChange(). After this, edit spreadsheet from outside by Sheet API v4.
When when spreadsheet was edited from outside by Sheet API v4, I used sendEmail() as a sample, because script editor is closed.</description>

      <description>gogauth is a CLI tool to easily retrieve access token for using APIs on Google.
I thought that if the access token can easily retrieve, it may be useful for users who can use various convenience Google APIs. So I created this. Also this can be used for testing sample script like the demo. If this will be helpful for you, I&amp;rsquo;m glad.
Today, it was updated to v2.0.1. Please check it out.</description>

      <description>This sample script retrieves the user information which is editing the shared spreadsheet.
It was found as follows.
 User information retrieving by Class Session is the owner and users which installed triggers by themselves. When each user installs a trigger, user information retrieving by Class Session losts the accuracy. So user information has to be retrieved using a temporally installed trigger. Using onOpen(), it cannot directly install triggers and authorize.</description>

Motivation Will you want to develop GAS using CoffeeScript on your local PC? Generally, when we develop GAS, we have to login to Google using own browser and develop it using Javascript on the Script Editor. Recently, I have wanted to have more convenient local-environment for developing GAS. So I created this &amp;ldquo;ggsrun&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>There are a lot of APIs on Google. When we use Google Drive APIs, they usually have &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; as a resource. The parameter &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; gives various information which is selected to us. This is one of important parameters. And this can be used at Google Apps Script (GAS) although that version is v2. About how to use it, there are some documents. But it is difficult to find how to use it at GAS.</description>

  Retrieves easily accesstoken from Google OAuth2 for using Drive API.
  If you have PhantomeJS, this retrieves &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; from Google using it. So you don&amp;rsquo;t need to launch your browser for retrieving &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This &amp;ldquo;souwapy&amp;rdquo; is a library for summing array elements with high speed by new algorithm (Pyramid method). The speed is faster than csv and panbdas module of python and v8 engine of node.js. The souwapy module is 2.3 and 3.1 times faster than csv and pandas module, respectively. This was really surprised me. It was found that the theory was correct.
At first, I have created this theory for Google Apps Script.</description>

      <description>I may be slow a bit, but I could notice much convenience of CoffeeScript just now. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that scripts of GAS can be made by CoffeeScript up until now. This will have me work more effectively! :D</description>

      <description>Abstract I have already reported that the pyramid method is one of very effectively algolithms for summing string elements in an array using Google Apps Script (GAS). This report describes the adaptability of the pyramid method to any languages except for GAS. c++ (g++), Go, Java, Javascript on Node.js, Python and Ruby were chosen as the sample languages. In those languages, there are languages which have the distinctive commands for summing the array elements.</description>

      <description>Abstract I considered an efficient algorithm for summation of array elements. All elements in an array are string. When those elements are summed using scripts, a standard method is to add each element in order. If the script is run without any optimize, the process becomes gradually sluggish, because the total amount of active data during the summation process is proportional to the square of the number of array elements. This leads directly to the high process-cost.</description>

      <description>This is a first post. Today this blog was launched. I would like to introduce some of my experimental results. I&amp;rsquo;m Japanese. So I&amp;rsquo;ll use both English and Japanese here. Thank you.</description>
